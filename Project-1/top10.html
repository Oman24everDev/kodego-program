            <p class="top10-origin">
              The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the
              United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and
              was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several
              countries, particularly in the Western world.
            </p>
            <p class="top10-content">
              The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly,
              outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family
              looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex,
              stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat
              comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and
              the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are
              famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize
              well with neighbor dogs and humans alike.

            <p class="top10-origin">
              A Goldendoodle, also known as the Doodle (in America), is bred from a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. First
              widely bred in 1990s, the crossbreed is bred in three different size varieties corresponding to the size
              variety of Poodle used as a parent.
            </p>
            <p class="top10-content">
              Goldendoodles are a highly affectionate crossbreed known for their intelligence and loyalty to their
              humans. Active and playful, doodles fit in well with families and are great for first-time dog owners.
              Smaller versions make good apartment dwellers, too.
              The beloved goldendoodle, a golden retriever and poodle hybrid, earns popularity points for his
              affectionate nature as well as his beautiful (and allergen-friendly!) coat.
              Available in both the larger standard size and as a smaller miniature, goldendoodles are playful yet
              gentle dogs that crave human interaction. They do best with daily walks or outdoor play sessions to fill
              their physical fitness needs and, because both of their parent breeds are friendly and highly intelligent,
              goldendoodles are ideal for families with small children, first-time dog owners, and as emotional support
              animals.

              The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth

              Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and

              Golden retrievers are smart, loyal dogs that are ideal family companions. With their gentle nature,

              The golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S.—for good reason. They are
              simultaneously wonderful family pets—thanks to their friendly, tolerant attitude—and capable, intelligent
              working dogs. These sturdy, medium-sized dogs grow to about 55 to 75 pounds and typically live to be about
              10 to 12 years old. Outgoing, trustworthy, eager-to-please, and easy-to-train, they are especially popular
              with families with young children. Goldens often maintain their fun-loving puppy attitudes and signature
              smile into adulthood.

              The French Bulldog, French: Bouledogue Français, is a French breed of companion dog or toy dog. It
              appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs
              imported from England and local Parisian ratters.

            <p class="top10-content">
              Bred primarily as companion dogs, Frenchies crave all the love and affection we humans have to offer.
              They're just as satisfied playing with kids and other dogs as they are being a couch potato. Goofy, yet
              intelligent, French bulldogs make an easygoing best friend for any dog lover.
              If your idea of the perfect pet is a pint-sized comedian with a special gift for napping, meet the French
              bulldog. These charming pups love to play just as much as they love to snuggle up on their owner's lap to
              take a snooze. They won't get taller than 13 inches at the shoulder, making them a great option for city
              dwellers. It doesn't take much space to keep a Frenchie happy. This breed has an easygoing personality and
              they make wonderful companions for families, children, or seniors. They're easy to groom and easy to
              please, and they thrive on human contact.

              A Labradoodle is a crossbreed dog created by crossing a Labrador Retriever and a Standard, Miniature, or
              Toy poodle. The term first appeared in 1955, but was unpopular. Labradoodles are considered a good choice
              for people with canine dander allergies, since some have the same hypoallergenic coat as their poodle

              A friendly, loving family dog who's easy on the allergies makes Labradoodles one of the most popular dog
              breeds in the United States. These dogs love activity, just not as much as they'll love you.
              Sup, 'doods! It's time to talk about Labradoodles. This combination Labrador retriever and poodle is an
              excellent family dog who's often sought out by allergy sufferers because of their minimal shedding.
              The ever-popular Labradoodle is immensely trainable and, unlike some dogs, a good fit for first-time dog
              owners. On the larger side, these pups can take up some space-but are great with kids and will adapt to
              their family's lifestyle. The standard version, which is a Lab bred with a standard-sized poodle, can grow
              to be about 24 inches tall and weigh up to 75 pounds. (If you're searching for a dog on the smaller size,
              it's possible to also find mini Labradoodles, a hybrid of a Labrador retriever and a miniature poodle.)

              The German Shepherd or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was

              and quick to learn.
              Confident, courageous, intelligent, and gentle—it's no wonder German shepherds are considered the second
              most popular dog breed in America. These large dogs are steadfastly loyal and protective of their humans
              but approach strangers with caution. Originally bred with a strong work ethic, German shepherds have a
              long history as working dogs who've assisted police and militaries across the world. But the average owner
              doesn't need to be on the front lines to keep a German shepherd happy. Their calm demeanor makes these
              dogs great companions for active owners who intend to spend hours at the dog park or afternoons on the

              its maximum size is 7 pounds (3.2 kg). A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part
              of the development of other breeds, such as the Silky Terrier. Most have a black and tan coat, but they
              are also known to have a silver-grey or a blonde coat.

              Yorkshire terriers, or Yorkies, are small, feisty, and dedicated to their owners. These former rat hunters
              now enjoy their status as fun, fearless companions especially suited for apartment life. Learn more about
              living with Yorkies.
              The Yorkshire terrier, or Yorkie, is a spunky, smart, small dog that is up for anything. Yorkies are the
              smallest of the terrier group, never getting larger than 7 pounds, but you wouldn't know it from their
              personalities. These feisty, fearless "tomboy" dogs were bred as ratters—meaning they were used for
              hunting rats—in northern England, and they've stuck true to their working-class roots. Yorkies are loyal
              and will take on any challenge in a New York minute.
              These pups have big personalities and the brains to match. A dedicated owner can train and socialize these
              little divas into delightful companions. Their indomitable spirit makes them great little watch dogs and
              amusing pals to keep you company.

              10. Cavalier King Charles spaniel
            </h1>
            <p class="top10-origin">
              The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a British breed of toy dog of spaniel type. Four colours are
              recognised: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby; the coat
              is smooth and silky. The lifespan is usually between eight and twelve years.

            <p class="top10-content">
              Tiny, noble, and extremely friendly, the Cavalier King Charles spaniel has become one of the most popular
              breeds in the world due to his ability to fit into almost any living situation.
              The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is one of the most popular breeds in the world—and one look at him makes
              it easy to see why. These little dogs have silky, flowing hair; adorable, friendly faces; and a
              personality that makes them eager to get along with literally everyone and everything.
              Bred purely as lapdogs, the Cavalier King Charles is smaller than most other spaniels and comes with a
              generally lower prey drive, relative to their other spaniel cousins. Instead, they are incredibly affable
              dogs who take a fast liking to strangers and family members, live well with other pets, and fit in
              comfortably with households of children or seniors.
