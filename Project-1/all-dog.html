                          Loyal, curious, and famously amusing, this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all
                          proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it's the Affenpinscher's apparent
                          seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.
                          The Affen's apish look has been described many ways. They've been called 'monkey dogs' and
                          'ape terriers.' The French say diablotin moustachu ('mustached little devil'), and Star
                          Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks. Standing less than a foot
                          tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. 'This isn't a
                          breed you train, 'a professional dog handler tells us, 'He's like a human. You befriend
                          him.' The dense, harsh coat is described as 'neat but shaggy' and comes in several
                          colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly
                          Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being
                          owned by their little monkey dogs.

                          Among the most eye-catching of all dog breeds, the Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified
                          aristocrat of sublime beauty. Despite his regal appearance, the Afghan can exhibit an
                          endearing streak of silliness and a profound loyalty.
                          Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the
                          thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed's crowning glory isn't just for show ' it
                          served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans
                          originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan's glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile
                          hound ' standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder ' built for a long day's hunt. Their
                          huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland's punishing terrain. The Afghan
                          Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, 'It's not the breed
                          for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal
                          can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.

                          His size, strength, and unflagging spirit have earned the Airedale Terrier the nickname
                          'The King of Terriers.' The Airedale stands among the world's most versatile dog breeds
                          and has distinguished himself as hunter, athlete, and companion.
                          The Airedale Terrier is the largest of all terrier breeds. Males stand about 23 inches at
                          the shoulder, females a little less. The dense, wiry coat is tan with black markings.
                          Long, muscular legs give Airedales a regal lift in their bearing, and the long head'¿with
                          its sporty beard and mustache, dark eyes, and neatly folded ears'¿conveys a keen
                          intelligence. Airedales are the very picture of an alert and willing terrier'¿only bigger.
                          And, like his smaller cousins in the terrier family, he can be bold, determined, and
                          stubborn. Airedales are docile and patient with kids but won't back down when protecting
                          hearth and home. Thanks to their famous do-it-all attitude, Airedales excel in all kinds
                          of sports and family activities.

                          The Akita is a muscular, double-coated dog of ancient Japanese lineage famous for their
                          dignity, courage, and loyalty. In their native land, they're venerated as family
                          protectors and symbols of good health, happiness, and long life.
                          Akitas are burly, heavy-boned spitz-type dogs of imposing stature. Standing 24 to 28
                          inches at the shoulder, Akitas have a dense coat that comes in several colors, including
                          white. The head is broad and massive, and is balanced in the rear by a full, curled-over
                          tail. The erect ears and dark, shining eyes contribute to an expression of alertness, a
                          hallmark of the breed. Akitas are quiet, fastidious dogs. Wary of strangers and often
                          intolerant of other animals, Akitas will gladly share their silly, affectionate side with
                          family and friends. They thrive on human companionship. The large, independent-thinking
                          Akita is hardwired for protecting those they love. They must be well socialized from birth
                          with people and other dogs.

                          An immensely strong, heavy-duty worker of spitz type, the Alaskan Malamute is an
                          affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified dog recognizable by his well-furred plumed
                          tail carried over the back, erect ears, and substantial bone. The Alaskan Malamute stands
                          23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests
                          their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and
                          dense, weatherproof coat all scream, 'I work hard for a living!' But their almond-shaped
                          brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans
                          when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family 'pack,' the leader
                          must be you. If a Mal doesn't respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other
                          way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a
                          well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with'¿playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids.

                          American Bulldogs are a well-balanced athletic dog that demonstrate great strength,
                          endurance, agility, and a friendly attitude. Historically, they were bred to be a utility
                          dog used for working the farm.
                          The American Bulldog is a descendant of the English Bulldog. It is believed that the
                          bulldog was in America as early as the 17th century. They came to the United States in the
                          1800s, with immigrants who brought their working bulldogs with them. Small farmers and
                          ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock
                          dogs, and catch dogs. The breed largely survived, particularly in the southern states, due
                          to its ability to bring down and catch feral pigs.
                          The breed we know as the American Bulldog was originally known by many different names
                          before the name American Bulldog became the standard. In different parts of the South he
                          was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just "bulldog." The
                          breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real
                          bulldog work.

                          These sleek and racy, lean but muscular hounds work dusk to dawn in pursuit of the wily
                          raccoon. The sight of the American English Coonhound tearing through the moonlit woods,
                          all sinew and determination, bawling their lusty night music, is coon-hunter heaven.
                          Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, American English Coonhounds are
                          deep-chested, sweet-faced athletes beloved by sportsmen for their speed and endurance.
                          Stretched tightly across the athletic frame is a medium-length coat of various patterns,
                          some with ticking. The head is broad with a domed skull, with soft, low-hung ears and
                          dark-brown eyes that glow with warmth and kindness. American English Coonhounds are mellow
                          when off duty but tenacious and stubborn in pursuit of their ring-tailed prey. Their work
                          drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting,
                          and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners.
                          Some passionate fans of American English Coonhounds feel that without a sporting outlet
                          for this breed's houndy virtues, you're simply wasting a good dog.

                          The American Eskimo Dog combines striking good looks with a quick and clever mind in a
                          total brains-and-beauty package. Neither shy nor aggressive, Eskies are always alert and
                          friendly, though a bit conservative when making new friends. The American Eskimo Dog comes
                          in three sizes'¿standard, miniature, and toy'¿standing as tall as 19 inches at the
                          shoulder or as short as 9 inches. Distinctive traits include a dense, sparkling white coat
                          with a lion-like ruff around the chest and shoulders; a smiling face, with black nose,
                          lips, and eye-rims that convey a keen, intelligent expression; and a plumed tail carried
                          over the back. Some Eskies have markings with the delicious color name 'biscuit cream.'
                          They move with a bold and agile gait. Eskies are social animals and can develop problem
                          behaviors when neglected or undertrained' they insist on being part of family life. Among
                          the most trainable of breeds, the clever, kid-friendly Eskie practically invented the
                          phrase 'eager to please.'

                          American Foxhounds are good-natured, low-maintenance hounds who get on well with kids,
                          dogs, even cats, but come with special considerations for prospective owners. They are
                          closely associated with Revolutionary heroes and the rolling estates of old Virginia.
                          American Foxhounds are sleek, rangy hunters known for their speed, endurance, and work
                          ethic. You can tell the American Foxhound apart from their British cousin the English
                          Foxhound by length of leg'¿the American's legs are longer and more finely boned'¿and by
                          the American's slightly arched loin (back end). American Foxhounds have large, soft eyes
                          with an expression described as gentle and pleading. So far, so good. But Foxhounds come
                          with special considerations. They need lots of exercise or they can get depressed and
                          destructive. A Foxhound's single-minded prey drive must be managed. Their loud bawling is
                          melodious to hound lovers but can be a nuisance to neighbors, and training and
                          housebreaking these independent souls can be a steep challenge for novice owners.

                          The American Hairless Terrier, a Louisiana native, is a smart, inquisitive, and playful
                          dog that comes in hairless and coated varieties. He is a fine choice for allergy sufferers
                          who want a dog with true terrier grit and courage.
                          The American Hairless Terrier stands between 12 to 16 inches at the shoulder, and comes in
                          both coated and hairless varieties. The hairless variety might have eyebrows and whiskers,
                          while the coated has a short, shiny coat. The skin of the hairless is smooth and warm to
                          the touch. The broad, wedge-shaped head is a hallmark of both varieties. Erect, V-shaped
                          ears frame the round, expressive eyes that gleam with curiosity.
                          The American Hairless moves with jaunty pep in his step that announces real terrier
                          attitude. The hairless variety is as hypoallergenic as a dog can get. Hairlessness,
                          though, presents its own challenges. Sunburn is a concern, and cold weather requires
                          special precautions. This breed is protective of their humans and make alert watchdogs.

                          Intelligence is one of the American Leopard Hound's very best attributes. The breed is
                          loving and affectionate toward their family and they are extremely protective of children.
                          American Leopards are one of the oldest tree dog breeds in the U.S. and have extremely
                          strong tracking abilities, often able to track prey for miles.
                          The American Leopard Hound is a medium to large size dog and comes in three patterns:
                          Solid, Leopard and Brindle; nine different official colors; and a variety of markings,
                          however, sixty percent of all American Leopards are solid-colored dogs. The breed is very
                          versatile in hunting a variety of game species including, but not limited to, raccoon,
                          bear, bobcat, cougar, squirrel, and any other tree-minded game. As an especially tough
                          breed, they also fare exceptionally well in extreme weather, both hot and cold.

                          The American Staffordshire Terrier, known to their fans as AmStaffs, are smart, confident,
                          good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized
                          AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end. AmStaffs are stocky, muscular bull-type
                          terriers standing 17 to 19 inches at the shoulder. The head is broad, the jaws well
                          defined, the cheekbones pronounced, and the dark, round eyes are set wide apart. AmStaff
                          movement is agile and graceful, with a springy gait that advertises the breed's innate
                          confidence. The stiff, glossy coat comes in many colors and patterns. AmStaffers describe
                          their dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and lovable
                          'personality dogs' around the house. AmStaffs like mental and physical challenges. They
                          are highly trainable, as their many forays into showbiz suggest. When acquiring an
                          AmStaff, there's only one way to go: Do your homework and find a responsible AKC breeder.

                          The American Water Spaniel, native to the lake country of the upper Midwest, is an upbeat,
                          outdoorsy athlete who loves to hunt and swim. They are known to be happy, eager, and
                          charming, though aloof with strangers and a bit stubborn. American Water Spaniels are
                          muscular midsize gundogs, not flashy in looks or performance, and recognizable by a
                          luscious brown coat that is either tightly curled or wavy. Bred to work the icy waters and
                          marshy banks of the Great Lakes region, these spaniels are ideally outfitted for the job:
                          The coat is dense and waterproof, the feet are thickly padded, the toes are webbed, and
                          the body is small enough for the dog to hop in and out of a skiff without rocking the
                          boat. The breed's admirers describe a merry, intelligent, and versatile spaniel suited to
                          a variety of dog sports. As hunters, they combine the working traits of spaniels and
                          retrievers. The key to the American Water Spaniel's happiness is activity, especially
                          alongside their adored human. An underemployed dog can be barky and destructive.

                          An Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a rugged, imposing flock guardian of ancient lineage.
                          Protective and territorial, but also intelligent, patient, and profoundly loyal, these
                          muscular avengers are prized as working guard dogs without equal. The Anatolian Shepherd
                          Dog stands between 27 and 29 inches at the shoulder and can weigh as much as 150 pounds.
                          Profusely muscled but nimble afoot, Anatolians are more than a match for the predators and
                          harsh terrain of their homeland. Anatolians descend from some of the oldest known
                          domestic-canine bloodlines. This lends the breed a sense of timelessness, a no-frills,
                          untouched quality that takes us back 6,000 years to the Bronze Age. Anatolians are smart,
                          devoted, responsive, and adaptable. They will protect their flock'¿livestock, children,
                          smaller dogs, even the family cat'¿with intensity. Anatolian owners must be strong
                          leaders, willing and able to handle a dog as dominating and demanding as he is calm and
                          loving.

                          Due to his personality and exercise needs, he is ill-suited to apartment living.

                          The compact but muscular Australian Cattle Dog, also called Blue Heeler or Queensland
                          Heeler, is related to Australia's famous wild dog, the Dingo. These resilient herders are
                          intelligent enough to routinely outsmart their owners. Standing between 17 to 20 inches at
                          the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and
                          agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns blue-gray or red. Both coat
                          varieties feature distinctive mottling or specking patterns. ACDs have immense work drive
                          and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy
                          and supple gait make them excellent running partners. ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously
                          smart, ever alert, and wary of strangers. If an ACD isn't challenged, he easily becomes
                          bored and gets into mischief. It is recommended that ACD owners participate with their dog
                          in some work, sport, or regular exercise to keep him mentally and physically fit.

                          The Australian Kelpie is a lithe, active dog, capable of untiring work. He is extremely
                          intelligent, alert, and eager with unlimited energy.
                          As a herding dog, the Australian Kelpie is intensely loyal and devoted to duty. He has a
                          natural instinct and aptitude for working in sheep, whether it be in open fields or
                          enclosed yards. This breed originated from Collie type dogs imported from Scotland, but
                          was developed to withstand the harsh heat and dry conditions of the vast open spaces of
                          Australia.

                          The Australian Shepherd, a lean, tough ranch dog, is one of those 'only in America'
                          stories: a European breed perfected in California by way of Australia. Fixtures on the
                          rodeo circuit, they are closely associated with the cowboy life. The Australian Shepherd,
                          the cowboy's herding dog of choice, is a medium-sized worker with a keen, penetrating gaze
                          in the eye. Aussie coats offer different looks, including merle (a mottled pattern with
                          contrasting shades of blue or red). In all ways, they're the picture of rugged and agile
                          movers of stock. Aussies exhibit an irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs,
                          kids. This strong work drive can make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner.
                          Aussies are remarkably intelligent, quite capable of hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice
                          owner. In short, this isn't the pet for everyone. But if you're looking for a brainy,
                          tireless, and trainable partner for work or sport, your search might end here.

                          The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is not an Australian Cattle Dog with a docked tail.
                          They are naturally bob-tailed breed and stands square with plenty of leg length under the
                          body.
                          There are major structural differences in breed type between the two breeds of Cattle
                          Dogs. Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs are a natural bob-tail breed. Some Stumpy Tail pups are born
                          with long tails and should not be discarded from a breeding program if they are of
                          structural quality, and bred back to quality natural bob tails.

                          The diminutive Australian Terrier is plucky, spirited, and smart'¿how did they fit so much
                          dog into such a bitty package? Upbeat and lively, the self-assured Aussie approaches life
                          with plenty of the old-time terrier curiosity and grit. Australian Terriers are small but
                          sturdy, self-confident terriers known for a longish torso, distinctive coat furnishings
                          around the neck and forequarters, and a topknot of soft, silky hair that contrasts in
                          texture with an otherwise harsh coat. A long neck lends a dash of elegance to this
                          rough-and-ready terrier, and the dark eyes sparkle with a keen intelligence. Coat colors
                          are blue-and-tan, or solid red or sandy. Aussies move with the free and easy gait of a
                          working dog. They are alert watchdogs and said to be quick studies when training. True
                          terriers, Aussies love digging, and the urge to chase small, furry critters has never left
                          them. Not always a great fit in multi-dog households, Aussies want you all to themselves.

                          Tall and elegant, the Azawakh is a West African sighthound who originates from the
                          countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may
                          come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color
                          (which may be predominantly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask
                          and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no
                          color or marking disqualifications in the breed. Befitting its heritage, the Azawakh
                          excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States.
                          This ancient hunting hound is so lean and rangy that his bone structure and musculature
                          can plainly be seen beneath his skin. The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and
                          aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters
                          that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine
                          coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of
                          elegance and fineness, but don't be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who's been
                          chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years.

                          An archetypic water dog of France, the Barbet is a rustic breed of medium size and
                          balanced proportions who appears in artwork as early as the 16th century. In profile, the
                          Barbet is slightly rectangular with a substantial head and long, sweeping tail. He has a
                          long, dense covering of curly hair and a distinctive beard. An agile athlete, the Barbet
                          has been used primarily to locate, flush, and retrieve birds. He has a cheerful
                          disposition and is very social and loyal. The defining characteristic of this rustic,
                          medium-sized bird dog is the dense curly coat that covers him from the top of his large,
                          broad head to the tip of his curving tail. The coat comes in shades of black, gray, brown,
                          or fawn, sometimes with white markings. The breed's delightfully shaggy coat and amiable
                          nature creates the impression of a Muppet come to life, but the Barbet is a strong,
                          solidly-built dog bred for centuries to be a keen hunter and tireless swimmer. Barbets are
                          very intelligent and learn new things quickly. They have a calm nature and are easy to
                          live with as long as their exercise needs are being met.

                          The Basenji, Africa's 'Barkless Dog,' is a compact, sweet-faced hunter of intelligence and
                          poise. They are unique and beguiling pets, best for owners who can meet their exercise
                          needs and the challenge of training this catlike canine. Basenjis are small, graceful
                          hounds standing 16 or 17 inches at the shoulder. They are recognizable by their glistening
                          short coat, tightly curled tail, and wrinkled forehead and expressive almond-shaped eyes
                          that convey a variety of subtle, humanlike emotions. Basenjis are a lovely sight at a
                          standstill but more impressive yet at a fast trot, when they exhibit the long, smooth
                          strides of a mini-racehorse. And yes, it's true, they don't bark, but they make their
                          feelings known with an odd sound described as something between a chortle and a yodel.
                          Basenjis are fastidious and will groom themselves like cats. This has been called a 'cult
                          breed'small in numbers, but those lucky enough to own one do so with singular devotion.

                          Smart, courageous and determined, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a serious hunter, easily
                          adaptable to different types of game and terrain. It is equally an excellent companion
                          dog, being cheerful, intelligent and eager to please.
                          The Basset Fauve de Bretagne, also known as the Fawn Colored Brittany Basset, is a small,
                          stocky, rough-coated hardy dog that is energetic and fast for its size. The Fauve gets
                          along well with children and other pets. Training and socialization is a must or Fauves
                          can get into mischief. Not nuisance barkers, you will, however, know if a rabbit runs
                          through the yard, as they then give the hound 'voice' and chase. This breed is as happy
                          romping in the field as he is curled up next to the family on the sofa.

                          Among the most appealing of the AKC breeds, the endearing and instantly recognizable
                          Basset Hound is a perennial favorite of dog lovers all over the world. This low-slung and
                          low-key hound can be sometimes stubborn, but is always charming. The Basset Hound stands
                          no higher than 14 inches at the shoulder but, with his remarkably heavy bone, powerful
                          little legs, and massive paws, he possesses big-dog strength and stamina. Bassets are
                          famous for a large, domed head that features extremely long, velvety ears, mournful eyes,
                          and a wrinkled brow, which give the breed the look of a sad clown. Built more for
                          endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner. The breed's
                          scenting ability is uncanny; it's said that among dogs only the Bloodhound's nose is more
                          accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a
                          loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections,
                          they are steadfastly loyal.

                          The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is calm and balanced, devoted to its owner, and reserved
                          with strangers. He is a sound, self-assured, unafraid, biddable dog, neither shy nor
                          aggressive.
                          Hailing from Germany, the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is the Bayerischer
                          Gebirgsschweisshund in its native German. The breed's most notable trait is its
                          outstanding "cold nose" tracking ability. His nose is so acute, he can distinguish between
                          the injured game he is hunting and other animals of the same species. This somewhat
                          lightweight, active, medium-sized breed is devoted to his owner, but can be reserved with
                          strangers. He is not a kennel dog and prefers to be around his human family.

                          Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also
                          happy-go-lucky, funny, and thanks to its pleading expression cute. They were bred to hunt
                          in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing. There are two Beagle
                          varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15
                          inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches, as dog folks say.
                          They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's
                          fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy
                          ears set low on a broad head. A breed described as merry by its fanciers, Beagles are
                          loving and lovable, happy, and companionable all qualities that make them excellent family
                          dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among
                          American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of
                          playtime.

                          (Beardie to his friends) enjoys outdoor exercise in all weather. Bred to be independent
                          decision-makers, they can be willful but are always friendly. Standing 20 to 22 inches at
                          the shoulder and covered head to tail in a shaggy double coat, Beardies bear a passing
                          resemblance to another British favorite, the Old English Sheepdog. Beneath the coats,
                          Beardies are the more lean and angular of the two. The lavish facial hair shouldn't
                          obscure the characteristic expression: a dreamy, faraway gaze. These rambunctious comics
                          can be a handful'¿but mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and
                          laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They
                          bore easily, and training must be kept interesting. Outdoorsy families looking for a
                          sturdy dog to share an uptempo lifestyle will never find a more affectionate and amusing
                          sidekick.

                          The Beauceron is imposing and powerful, but also remarkably smart, spirited, and a
                          versatile herder. Imagine a Border Collie's brain in a 100-pound body. They are especially
                          beloved by women as a dashing but sensitive companion and protector.
                          Beaucerons are muscular, rugged, and large, standing as high as 27.5 inches at the
                          shoulder, and yet graceful and in all ways balanced. Their dark black coats feature
                          handsome squirrel-red accents, including the red feet that give the breed its French
                          nickname Bas-Rouge ('red stockings'). They're also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long
                          head is well chiseled, and the dark brown eyes project expression breed fanciers describe
                          as frank and confident. They're not for novice owners, who might end up being owned by
                          their dominant dog instead of the other way around. That said, well-trained and socialized
                          Beaucerons are levelheaded watchdogs and guardians, especially good with the young, the
                          small, and the defenseless.

                          Bedlingtons are lithe, energetic Englishmen. The crisp, curly coat; arched back; tasseled
                          ears; scimitar-shaped tail; and fleecy, pear-shaped head are identifying features of this

                          Strong, agile and full of life, the Belgian Laekenois (pronounced "Lak-in-wah") is one of
                          four native dogs of Belgium. Although similar in body and temperament to the Malinois,
                          Shepherd and Tervuren, the Laekenois differs in coat color, texture and length, as well as
                          region of origin.
                          Of the four closely related Belgian herders, the Belgian Sheepdog, Malinois, Tervuren, and
                          Laekenois, the Laekenois is the rarest. This strong and sturdy dog is distinguished from
                          his brethren by a rough, tousled coat that comes in shades of red or fawn or in grayish
                          tones. The blackening around the muzzle points up the expression of keen watchfulness
                          shining from the dark almond-shaped eyes. The Belgian Laekenois is protective of his
                          master and property. Although observant with strangers, the breed is affectionate and
                          friendly with those he knows well. The Laekenois coat requires regular brushing and
                          occasional bathing, and as a working dog, it needs daily exercise.

                          The smart, confident, and versatile Belgian Malinois is a world-class worker who forges an
                          unbreakable bond with his human partner. To deny a Mal activity and the pleasure of your
                          company is to deprive him of his very reasons for being. Belgian Malinois are squarely
                          built, proud, and alert herders standing 22 to 26 inches. Strong and well-muscled, but
                          more elegant than bulky, there's an honest, no-frills look about them, as befit dogs built
                          to work hard for their feed. A breed hallmark is the proud carriage of the head. Coat
                          colors range from a rich fawn to mahogany. The black ears and mask accentuate bright,
                          questioning eyes the color of dark Belgian chocolate. If you have ever seen a Mal perform
                          an obedience routine, you know firsthand what a smart and eager breed this is. Problems
                          set in, though, when this people-oriented dog is underemployed and neglected. Exercise,
                          and plenty of it, preferably side by side with their adored owner, is key to Mal
                          happiness.

                          The Belgian Sheepdog is a highly trainable herder whose versatility and intelligence is
                          the stuff of canine legend. This is a breed built for hard work, and plenty of it. These
                          sensitive souls crave human companionship and abhor neglect. The stirring silhouette of a
                          Belgian Sheepdog conveys both elegance and muscular determination. A handsome feature of
                          the breed is the exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck. A male might stand 26
                          inches at the shoulder; females are smaller. The dark eyes sparkle with a questioning
                          intelligence, and the black coat is abundant, from the neck's collarette to the breeches
                          of the hindquarters. In all ways, Belgian Sheepdogs are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. In
                          any sport or activity, a Belgian will always give 100 percent. In turn, owners tend to
                          form a special bond with their eager workaholics. As one devotee puts it, Belgians inspire
                          such intense loyalty because they themselves live and love with such great passion.

                          The elegant, agile Belgian Tervuren is a bright and self-assured herding dog of medium
                          size, known to be affectionate and possessive with loved ones. Lots of hard work and
                          challenging play is heaven for this tireless, do-it-all dog. The Belgian Tervuren is
                          characterized by a straight and abundant coat, an elegant but muscular frame, a proudly
                          carried head, an alert and intelligent demeanor, and an insatiable work drive. The Terv's
                          coat furnishings, like the sporty collarette around the neck, are more profuse on males,
                          who run larger than females. 'Their intelligence and high activity level can be a
                          challenge for the less creative individual who may not understand the breed's need to
                          work,' warns one longtime owner. But don't get the idea that Tervs are grim, mechanical
                          worker drones. In fact, Tervs take real delight in their ability to master any task, and
                          owners say a mischievous sense of humor is at work whenever Tervs outsmart their beloved
                          human.

                          Generally happy with kids and other animals, the low-maintenance and robustly healthy
                          Bergamasco is much more than a show-stopping hairdo. Eager to please, smart, and
                          stubbornly devoted to work, Bergamascos are patient but protective.
                          Beneath the one-of-a-kind coat is a large, muscular shepherd dog of ancient pedigree. But,
                          since the coat is the breed's hallmark, let's take a close look. The Bergamasco Sheepdog
                          has hair of three different textures that form naturally occurring loose mats, or 'flocks'
                          (strands of hair woven together, creating flat layers of felted hair), covering the body
                          and legs. The flocks provide protection from the fierce cold and wild predators of the
                          Italian Alps, the breed's ancestral homeland. Bergamascos are bright, loyal, loving, and
                          trainable' with a dash of mountain-dog independence. They take to watching over loved ones
                          with a serene vigilance. Wary of strangers until properly introduced, Bergamascos are
                          aggressive only as a last resort.

                          The Berger Picard is a lanky herding dog of strong bone and sturdy build. Picards spent
                          centuries as take-charge independent problem-solvers, so early socialization and positive
                          training are necessary to cope with their stubborn streak. You can spot a Berger Picard a
                          mile away thanks to his erect ears standing 4 to 5 inches high, a wavy fawn or brindle
                          coat, and a strong tail that tapers to a distinctive J-hook. Males stand as high as 26
                          inches, and females as low as 21 inches. The eyes are dark and glistening, and the
                          rectangular head is furnished with shaggy eyebrows, beard, and mustache'¿ the very image
                          of a sagacious and worldly Frenchman. The Berger Picard is an ideal companion for athletic
                          owners. Their rugged constitution, agility, and boundless energy make them eager partners
                          in all kinds of sports, games, and outdoor pastimes. Exercise is a must; prolonged
                          idleness and neglect will likely lead these sensitive, super-smart dogs to destructive
                          behavior.

                          Big, powerful, and built for hard work, the Bernese Mountain Dog is also strikingly
                          beautiful and blessed with a sweet, affectionate nature. Berners are generally placid but
                          are always up for a romp with the owner, whom they live to please. The Bernese Mountain
                          Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick,
                          silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The
                          distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the
                          intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Berner's aura of majestic nobility. A hardy
                          dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner's brain and brawn helped him multitask on the
                          farms and pastures of Switzerland. Berners get along with the entire family and are
                          particularly gentle with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky
                          human. Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof dignity with
                          strangers.

                          under a foot tall at the shoulder. The breed's glory is a white hypoallergenic coat, plush
                          and velvety to the touch, featuring rounded head hair that sets off the large, dark eyes
                          and black leathers of the nose and lips. Bichons are adaptable companions who get on well
                          with other dogs and children. Alert and curious, Bichons make nice little watchdogs'¿but
                          they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no
                          strangers, just friends they haven't met yet. Their confidence and size make them ideal
                          city dogs. Bichons train nicely and enjoy performing for their loved ones. Finally,
                          there's the happy-go-lucky Bichon personality that draws smiles and hugs wherever they go.

                          like to carry toys in their mouths. He is quick to alert you to company, but is not a

                          Large, athletic hunters who work nights, Black and Tan Coonhounds are friendly, easygoing
                          hounds who love company. They are snoozy by the fireside but tenacious when on the trail
                          of the wily raccoon. The Black and Tan Coonhound is a real American original.
                          Black and Tans have an amazingly sensitive nose, long, velvety ears, and a sweet
                          disposition. The coal-black coat features rich tan accents, including the distinctive
                          'pumpkin seeds' above keenly expressive eyes. These are big, strong hounds: A good-size
                          male can stand 27 inches at the shoulder and cover ground with effortless, eager strides.
                          Black and Tan Coonhounds are sociable hounds. A lonely Black and Tan Coonhound will
                          serenade the neighborhood with loud, mournful 'music.' Black and Tan Coonhounds can keep
                          pace with the most active family, but they also can hog the sofa for hours on end. Hounds
                          will be hounds: A passing squirrel can arouse Black and Tan Coonhound prey drive in no
                          time flat, so a strong leash and sturdy fence are must-haves. Black and Tan Coonhounds
                          might be too much hound for the lifestyle of every owner.

                          The Black Russian Terrier is a large, immensely powerful worker of heavy bone and coarse
                          all-black coat. BRTs are known for their courage, confidence, and intelligence. Bred to
                          guard and protect, they are naturally aloof with strangers. What's the word we're looking
                          for? Imposing? Massive? Majestic? How about just plain big. This brawny guard dog of the
                          Siberian steppes can tip the scales at 140 pounds and stand as high as 30 inches at the
                          shoulder. They're much taller when the huge, brick-shaped head is considered. The tousled,
                          all-black coat is warm enough to allow BRTs to patrol some of the coldest habitable places
                          on earth. The old expression 'He moves well for a big guy' applies to this nimble-footed
                          giant.

                          The world-famous 'Sleuth Hound' does one thing better than any creature on earth: find
                          people who are lost or hiding. An off-duty Bloodhound is among the canine kingdom's most
                          docile citizens, but he's relentless and stubborn on a scent.
                          Bloodhounds are large, substantial dogs standing 23 to 27 inches at the shoulder and
                          weighing up to 110 pounds. Their most famous features are a long, wrinkled face with loose
                          skin; huge, drooping ears; and warm, deep-set eyes that complete an expression of solemn
                          dignity. Coat colors can be black and tan, liver and tan, or red. Powerful legs allow
                          Bloodhounds to scent over miles of punishing terrain. As pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy
                          company, including other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes
                          lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy
                          sniffing around are recommended. Bloodhounds are droolers, and obedience training these
                          sensitive sleuths can be a challenge.

                          The sleekly beautiful Bluetick Coonhound is a sweet and affectionate charmer who might
                          enjoy snoozing in the shade, but in pursuit of quarry he is relentless, bold, and
                          single-minded. His off-the-charts prey drive must be channeled. Blueticks are speedy and
                          compact nocturnal hunters named for the mottled (or ticked) black-and-blue pattern of the
                          glossy coat. A large male can top out at 27 inches and 80 pounds; females are smaller.
                          Blueticks are well-muscled but sleek and racy, never chunky or clumsy. The baying,
                          bawling, and chopping bark of Blueticks might be cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters
                          it's the music of the night. The droopy-eared charm of Blueticks is irresistible. They
                          crave affection and are deeply devoted to those who provide it. Blueticks have tremendous
                          prey drive. Neglected, underemployed coonhounds with no outlet for their hardwired
                          impulses can develop problem behaviors, like serenading the neighbors with loud, mournful
                          music.

                          Boerboels are intimidating but discerning guardians of home and family who learned their
                          trade while protecting remote South African homesteads from ferocious predators. They are
                          dominant and confident, also bright and eager to learn. There's a no-frills, no-nonsense
                          quality to this sleek-coated avenger, who might stand as high as 27 inches at the shoulder
                          and weigh as much as you do. A broad and blocky head, powerful jaws, and thick muscles
                          from neck to rump mark it as a descendant of the ancient 'molloser' dog family, the
                          foundation of today's mastiff-type breeds. In motion, the Boerboel just might be the most
                          agile of all mastiff types. The imposing Boerboel is devoted to protecting the people and
                          places he loves. Training and socialization should begin early, before a pup becomes a
                          dominant adult. This is a trainable, versatile breed, eager to spend time with their
                          adored humans. Still, a Boerboel might be way too much dog for the novice owner to handle.

                          They succeed in many arenas such as agility, dog dancing, schutzhund, search and rescue,
                          nose work, tracking, pastoral work, obedience, therapy dogs, service dogs, and are now
                          breaking into the fields of coursing, dock diving and endurance tests. The Bohemian
                          Shepherd makes an excellent family dog due to its devotion to family members and adoration
                          of children. This is a breed which loves to be with its family and also does well with
                          other non-human members of the family when raised with them.

                          Bolognese is small, stocky, and squarely built. He is rather serene and inactive, and
                          devoted to his master and his people. They can be shy towards strangers, but warm up
                          quickly if they are properly socialized. Prone to separation anxiety, the Bolognese does
                          not do well alone for long periods of time. They would be ill-suited for people with a 9-5
                          workday.

                          A remarkably bright workaholic, the Border Collie is an amazing dog maybe a bit too
                          amazing for owners without the time, energy, or means to keep it occupied. These energetic
                          dogs will settle down for cuddle time when the workday is done. Borders are athletic,
                          medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of
                          a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth
                          coat come in a variety of colors and patterns. The almond eyes are the focus of an
                          intelligent expression an intense gaze, the Border's famous herding eye, is a breed
                          hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdom's most agile, balanced, and
                          durable citizens. The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a
                          perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, like agility'¿or herding or
                          obedience work is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved
                          with strangers.

                          Admirers of the upbeat and agile Border Terrier cherish their breed's reputation as a
                          tough, no-frills working terrier. These plucky, happy, and affectionate dogs are popular
                          pets in town and country. The wiry coat is an easy keeper. Border Terriers, standing from
                          11 to 16 inches at the shoulder, are easy to recognize among other small terriers by their
                          unique head shape the breed has an otter head, as fanciers say. Another distinguishing
                          trait is that they are longer in leg than other small terriers. The wire coat can be
                          grizzle and tan, blue and tan, wheaten, or red. Borders are described as hard as nails
                          when working, but at home they're good-tempered, affectionate, and trainable. Borders love
                          exploring outdoors and make fine childhood playmates. Bred to be country dogs, Borders
                          adapt well to city life as long as they get plenty of exercise. Borders tend to get along
                          with other dogs, but their hunting instincts can be aroused when cats or squirrels cross
                          their path.

                          Among the most impressively beautiful of all dogs, the aristocratic Borzoi is cherished
                          for his calm, agreeable temperament. In full stride, he is a princely package of strength,
                          grace, and glamour flying by at 35 to 40 miles per hour. Borzoi are large, elegant
                          sighthounds. A mature male stands at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 105
                          pounds. Females will be smaller. Beneath the luxurious silky coat, Borzoi construction
                          follows the ancient Greyhound template. One known as the Russian Wolfhound, Borzoi were
                          bred to be swift and tough enough to pursue and pin their ferocious lupine quarry. In
                          their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with
                          patience, consistency, and good humor. Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a
                          bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or
                          squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room
                          is a must.

                          The Boston Terrier is a lively little companion recognized by his tight tuxedo jacket,
                          sporty but compact body, and the friendly glow in his big, round eyes. His impeccable
                          manners have earned him the nickname The American Gentleman. Boston Terriers are compact,
                          short-tailed, well-balanced little dogs weighing no more than 25 pounds. The stylish
                          tuxedo coat can be white and either black, brindle, or seal (dark brown). The head is
                          square, the muzzle is short, and the large, round eyes can shine with kindness, curiosity,
                          or mischief. Ever alert to their surroundings, Bostons move with a jaunty, rhythmic step.
                          It's a safe bet that a breed named for a city the Havanese or Brussels Griffon, for
                          instance will make an excellent urban pet. Bostons are no exception: they are sturdy but
                          portable, people-oriented, and always up for a brisk walk to the park or outdoor cafe. A
                          bright dog with a natural gift for comedy, the dapper Bostonian is a steady source of
                          smiles.

                          accented by beard and mustache, Bouviers can do anything that needs doing in a barnyard or
                          pasture except milk the cows. And yet, Bouviers are more than just farm equipment. Their

                          females run smaller. Their muscles ripple beneath a short, tight-fitting coat. The dark
                          brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. The coat can be
                          fawn or brindle, with white markings. Boxers move like the athletes they are named for:
                          smooth and graceful, with a powerful forward thrust. Boxers are upbeat and playful. Their
                          patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children.
                          They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats
                          fearlessly. Boxers do best when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early
                          puppyhood.

                          A medium-sized flushing and retrieving dog known for its rich brown coat, the Boykin
                          Spaniel is avid, eager, merry, and trainable. This mellow housedog and tenacious bird dog
                          was once South Carolina's best-kept secret. Boykins are medium-sized spaniels, larger and
                          rangier than Cockers but more compact than Springers. The breed's hallmark is a beautiful
                          solid-brown coat. Colors range from a rich liver to a luscious chocolate. The large,
                          feathery ears hang close to the cheeks, setting off an expression of soulful intelligence.
                          Bred to work in the lakes and swamps of their native South Carolina, web-toed Boykins can
                          swim like seals. For years, Boykins were known only to hunters of Carolina waterfowl and
                          wild turkey. But lately, the wider world has discovered that the Boykin is as delightful
                          at home as he is eager at the lake. They are very, very sweet dogs to have around the
                          family, a longtime owner says, but an absolute tiger in the field.

                          The Bracco Italiano is one of the oldest of the pointing breeds. It was introduced into
                          the United States in the 1990s and has remained true to its heritage as a versatile gun
                          dog. It is gentle in the home and tireless in the field.
                          Tough and adapted to all types of hunting, the Bracco Italiano is reliable, intelligent,
                          docile and easy to train. He has a powerful appearance, with lean limbs, well-developed
                          muscles and a sculpted head. In English, he is the Italian Pointing Dog.

                          Pronounced brock-do-bor-bon-NAY, this pointer has a calm, gentle demeanor that is ideally
                          suited for the foot hunter. The breed's relatively small size and short coat well suits
                          them as an ideal home companion for the family that hunts. The Bourbonnais is an ancient
                          breed that evolved in France during the 15th century in the historic province of
                          Bourbonnais. By the 1800s, the breed was known amongst French hunters as a tailless
                          pointer with distinctive fawn and liver ticking. The Braque du Bourbonnais has now gained
                          a strong foothold in North America; some years there are more pups registered in the
                          United States than its homeland of France. In English, he is the Bourbonnais Pointing Dog.
                          He is kind and affectionate in the home and a serious, adaptable, intelligent hunter in
                          the field.

                          The Braque Francais Pyrenean is a rustic breed and hails from France. In English, he is
                          the French Pointing Dog Pyrenean Type.
                          The Braque Francais Pyrenean is a well-proportioned, medium-sized dog with a soft,
                          shorthaired coat. He was bred to hunt the very rugged and arid Pyrenees Mountain range on
                          the border of France and Spain. The breed dates back hundreds of years and is considered
                          the common ancestor to all of today's shorthaired pointing breeds. There are actually two
                          types of Braque Francais: the Gascony Type and the Pyrenean type. The Braque Francais
                          Pyrenean is the smaller and more popular of the two. He has a natural retrieve instinct
                          and loves water. He is gentle, friendly sociable, and submissive.

                          The Briard packs so much loyalty, love, and spirit into its ample frame that it's often
                          described as a "heart wrapped in fur." The dashing good looks of these muscular Frenchmen
                          radiate a distinct aura of Gallic romance and elegance. Briards are herders known for a
                          wavy coat of either gray, tawny, or black, and an impressive head topped by a peek-a-boo
                          hairdo parted naturally in the middle. A luxurious beard and eyebrows accentuate an
                          expression described as frank and questioning. Standing between 22 and 27 inches at the
                          shoulder, Briards are burly and rugged but move with a nimble-footed gait. They possess
                          traits common to many other herders: trainability, brains, a protective eye toward family
                          (especially kids, whom they regard as their flock), and wariness with outsiders. These are
                          large, tireless dogs'¿it is said that just two or three Briards can handle 700 head of
                          sheep and novice owners might be overwhelmed by their work drive and zest for life.

                          and versatile gundog. Bright and eager at home, and tireless afield, Brittanys require a
                          lot of exercises, preferably with their favorite humans. Brittanys are smaller than
                          setters but leggier than spaniels, standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. Their
                          beautiful, boldly patterned coat comes in combinations of white and vivid orange and liver
                          (reddish-brown). They are rugged and strong but smooth, clean, and quick afoot. The face
                          has the softness prized by bird-dog lovers; high-set ears convey the breed's essential
                          eagerness. The zeal and versatility that make Brittanys peerless hunters can be channeled
                          into dog sports. Obedience, agility, flyball, dock diving you name it, this trainable
                          breed is up for it. The Brittany is a nice fit for those seeking an all-purpose hunting
                          partner, a dog-sport teammate, or a companion in sync with an upbeat, outdoorsy family
                          life.

                          Calm, good-natured, yet watchful and confident, the Broholmer hails from Denmark and makes
                          a great family companion. A large, mastiff-type dog, the Broholmer is rectangular and
                          strongly built with a wide, massive head. Around the year 1800, a Danish dog book
                          described him as a very ordinary breed, especially around Copenhagen. His nickname was
                          "the butcher's dog," as he was often seen lying at the doorsteps of butcher shops. He was
                          a protector of the home and a herder and guard dog of cattle at the farm and in the city's
                          markets. Today, his size is the only thing that keeps intruders at bay. The Broholmer has
                          a heart of gold, loves to snuggle, and always wants to be near you, though his preference
                          is to sit on you. He is an excellent dog with children and other dogs, though because he
                          seems to underestimate his size, supervision is recommended. This breed is also remarkably
                          agile for his size and can do agility, fetch balls, and jump and catch frisbees. Anything
                          you do, camping, hiking, picnicking, walks in the park, he will be more than happy to go
                          along with you.

                          Tipping the scales at no more than 12 pounds, this humanlike toy of complex character has
                          enough personality for 10 ordinary dogs. A sensitive companion for discerning grownups,
                          the Brussels Griffon is smart, devoted, and comically self-important.
                          With this breed, you get a big personality in a 5-to-15-pound package. One look into his
                          big, human-like eyes, and you'll be smitten. Griffs come in four colors red,
                          black-and-reddish-brown (called belge), black and tan, and black and in smooth coats (like
                          a Pug) or rough coats (like a Schnauzer). Their black muzzle and whiskers earned them the
                          nickname 'bearded dogs' in old folk songs. The Griff's big black eyes described as 'almost
                          human' coupled with a fringed beard and mustache covering his short muzzle, gives him the
                          air of a worldly, French-speaking philosopher. Griffs come in four colors: red,
                          black-and-reddish-brown (called belge), black and tan, and black and in smooth coats or
                          rough coats. The Griff's body is thickset and sturdy, and he moves with the purposeful
                          trot of a fellow who knows what he wants. Griffs are alert, sociable, and easily trained.
                          Although playful and energetic, their small size and sensitive nature make them a poor
                          choice as roughhousing playmates for kids. They have a low threshold for loneliness and
                          will stick close to their special human, providing years of love and laughter.

                          Among the most comical and mischievous citizens of dogdom, the Bull Terrier is playful and
                          endearing, sometimes stubborn, but always devoted. These unique eggheads are exuberant,
                          muscular companions who thrive on affection and exercise. Bull Terriers are robust,
                          big-boned terriers who move with a jaunty stride suggesting agility and power. The breed's
                          hallmark is a long, egg-shaped head with erect and pointed ears, and small, triangular
                          eyes that glisten with good humor. Coats come in two types: white; and any other color
                          (including an attractive brindle striping), either solid or with white markings. A
                          well-made BT is the picture of muscular determination and balance. There are four keys to
                          BT happiness: early socialization with dogs and people; firm but loving training; ample
                          exercise; and lots of quality time with his adored humans. If these requirements are met,
                          there is no more loyal, lovable, and entertaining companion. This is the ultimate
                          personality breed.

                          You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed

                          distinctive rolling gait all practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!' The coat, seen in a
                          variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50
                          pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But
                          don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'¿Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need
                          regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are
                          best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored
                          breathing in hot and humid weather.

                          Fearless at work, docile at home, the Bullmastiff is a large, muscular guarder who pursued and
                          held poachers in Merry Old England'¿merry, we suppose, for everyone but poachers. Bullmastiffs
                          are the result of Bulldog and Mastiff crosses. The Bullmastiff isn't quite as large as his
                          close cousin the Mastiff. Still, standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing
                          between 100 and 130 pounds, this is still a whole lot of dog. After the first impression made
                          by the Bullmastiff's size, it is the large, broad head that conveys the breed's essence: the
                          dark eyes, high-set V-shaped ears, and broad, deep muzzle all combine to present the
                          intelligence, alertness, and confidence that make the Bullmastiff a world-class protector and
                          family companion. Coats come in fawn, red, or brindle. These are biddable and reliable
                          creatures, but as with any large guarding dog, owners must begin training and socialization
                          early, while the puppy is still small enough to control.

                          standing 19 to 24 inches at the shoulder. The coat is straight and harsh, and comes in various
                          colors and patterns. Erect, expressive ears and dark almond eyes convey an inquisitive
                          expression. Canaans move at a brisk, natural trot. They are rugged, agile, and apparently
                          tireless, making them a nice fit for hikers and runners. Canaans are clever, confident, and
                          territorial. They will end up "owning" passive owners who haven't establish themselves as top
                          dog in the family pack. Early training and socialization are key. When positive methods are
                          applied, these ancient wonder-dogs train beautifully. Agility, obedience, herding trials, and
                          sentry duty are a few outlets for their work ethic.

                        Smart, trainable, and of noble bearing, the assertive and confident Cane Corso is a peerless
                        protector. The Corso's lineage goes back to ancient Roman times, and the breed's name roughly
                        translates from the Latin as 'bodyguard dog.' At nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often
                        weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscles rippling beneath
                        their short, stiff coat, Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures. Their imposing appearance
                        is their first line of defense against intruders. As one writer put it, An understated air of
                        cool competence, the kind of demeanor you'd expect from a professional bodyguard, is the breed's
                        trademark. Corsi are intelligent, loyal, eager to please, versatile, and intensely loyal to
                        their humans, but are also assertive and willful, and can end up owning an unwitting owner. As
                        with any other big guardian dog, responsible breeding and early socialization with people and
                        other dogs is vital.

                          The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a masterpiece of the breeder's art: Every aspect of its makeup is
                          perfectly suited to moving cattle, and yet it is so congenial and sweet-faced that it would be
                          a
                          cherished companion even if it never did a day's work. Long, low-set dogs with sturdy bone,
                          short legs, and a deep chest, Cardigans are powerful workers of deceptive speed and grace.
                          Cardis can weigh anywhere from 25 to 34 pounds, with females at the lower end of the scale.
                          They
                          come in several coat colors, from red to the popular blue-merle pattern. The quickest way to
                          distinguish Cardis from their cousins, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, is to check out the
                          hindquarters:
                          Cardigans have tails; Pembrokes do not. Cardis are trainable, faithful, and vigilant guardians
                          with a 'big dog' bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable with
                          other pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on
                          mental stimulation and physical activity.

                          Carolina Dogs are generally shy and suspicious in nature, but once a dog accepts a human into
                          its pack, those behaviors disappear toward that human. A sighthound of medium build, they have
                          the general appearance of a jackal or wolf.
                          Carolina dogs are descended from the canines that accompanied the Paleo-Indians who traveled
                          from Asia to North America over the Bering land bridge. Today, they can still be found living
                          wild near the Georgia-South Carolina border, but have also been seen as far north as Ohio and
                          Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona; rural areas are the common denominator. The typical
                          Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it
                          is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis
                          familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who's at the
                          door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic. Carolina Dogs have an extreme pack
                          mentality, as this was a necessity for survival in the wild.

                          The Catahoula Leopard Dog is a multi-purpose working dog that is well-muscled and powerful,
                          but
                          with a sense of agility and endurance. They are serious while working and playful at home. The
                          Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium-large, short-coated dog, known for its many varied coat and
                          eye colors and patterns. The word is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean "sacred
                          lake."
                          Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of
                          Louisiana.
                          The breed requires firm guidance and early socialization, as they can be independent,
                          territorial, and protective. For the same reasons, they do not allow mistreatment and will
                          assert themselves in self-defense. Once they know their place in the family unit, they are
                          affectionate, loyal, and gentle. Also called the Catahoula Hog Dog, they are used as stock
                          dogs,
                          bay dogs, tree dogs, watchdogs, guard dogs, and of course as loyal companions.

                          The Caucasian Shepherd dog is a serious guardian breed and should never be taken lightly. The
                          Caucasian is bold, fearless, self-confident and fierce when a threat is present, but he is
                          soft,
                          devoted, kind and endearing to his family, including other family pets. Caucasian Shepherd
                          dogs
                          were used for centuries to protect properties from trespassers, guard livestock from large and
                          small predators such as wolves and coyotes, and for many other duties. In modern days,
                          especially in the West, they're most commonly companions and watchdogs. There is a great
                          variety
                          of types among the Caucasian dogs depending on their home region. For almost a century, there
                          has been two breed types and standards: The Mountain type, which is long-coated and has a
                          heavier body mass than the Steppe type, a shorter-coated dog with a lighter body mass. Other
                          names for the breed include Caucasian Ovcharka, Caucasian Sheepdog, Kawkasky Owtscharka, and
                          Kaukasische Schaferhund.

                          verve and athleticism of a sporting spaniel. The Cavalier's all-around beauty, regal grace,
                          and
                          even temper mark him as one of dogdom's noblemen. A toy spaniel no more than 13 inches high,
                          the
                          Cavalier draws you in with his face: The sweet, gentle, melting expression emanating from
                          large,
                          round eyes is a breed hallmark. Another is the silky, richly colored coat that can be one of
                          four distinct varieties (described in this page's History section). Cavaliers may be
                          aristocrats, but they gladly descend from their royal high horse for a backyard frolic or a
                          squirrel chase. They get along nicely with children and other dogs. Adaptable Cavaliers do
                          equally well with active owners and homebodies'¿they can be upbeat athletes or shameless couch
                          potatoes, depending on an owner's lifestyle.

                          The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is self-assured, balanced, quiet, proud and independent. They
                          are
                          very courageous and have a high working capacity, endurance and a natural instinct of
                          territory.
                          This breed is known for its fearlessness towards large predators. Central Asian Shepherd Dogs
                          are a natural protective breed that require a non-stop observance for the life of the dog.
                          They
                          are not for first-time dog owners. They were formed as a breed from natural selection during
                          more than four thousand years in a vast territory, which spreads nowadays from the Caspian Sea
                          to China and from Southern Ural to Afghanistan.

                          The Cesky Terrier, national dog of the Czech Republic, is a clever and adventurous playmate
                          for
                          kids and an eager walking buddy for the folks. They are tenacious at work, but a little more
                          laid back and tractable than the usual terrier. Ceskys are muscular, short-legged, and
                          handsome
                          hunters standing no taller than 13 inches at the shoulder. The fine, silky coat comes in
                          several
                          shades of gray, including a stunning platinum. Wavy facial hair gives Ceskys a sporty,
                          Continental look, and the medium-long neck lends a dash of elegance to these game, unspoiled
                          working terriers. While Ceskys are as determined and prey-driven as any other earthdog,
                          they're
                          mellower than a typical terrier. Wary of strangers and protective of loved ones, they're good
                          watchdogs without being particularly yappy. They train well and want to please. Here's the
                          catch: They are a scarce breed, with only about 600 living in America. A wonderful family dog,
                          if you're lucky enough to find one.

                          The Chesapeake Bay Retriever, peerless duck dog of the Mid-Atlantic, is an American original
                          who
                          embodies the classic traits of a good retriever: loyal, upbeat, affectionate, and tireless.
                          The
                          Chessie is famous for his waterproof coat. Chessies are strong, powerfully built gundogs
                          standing anywhere from 21 to 26 inches at the shoulder. A male can weigh up to 80 pounds. The
                          distinctive breed trait is a wavy coat that is oily to the touch. Chessies are solid-colored,
                          either chocolatey brown, sedge, or deadgrass, with keen yellow-amber eyes that nicely
                          complement
                          the coat. Chessies are more emotionally complex than the usual gundog. Chessies take to
                          training, but they have a mind of their own and can tenaciously pursue their own path. They
                          are
                          protective of their humans and polite, but not overtly friendly, to strangers. Chessies make
                          excellent watchdogs and are versatile athletes. A well-socialized Chessie is a confident
                          companion and world-class hunting buddy.

                          The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico, these alert
                          and amusing "purse dogs" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas, with a lineage going
                          back to the ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times. The Chihuahua is a balanced, graceful dog
                          of terrier-like demeanor, weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded "apple" head is a breed
                          hallmark. The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many
                          colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat.
                          Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and
                          without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and
                          confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and
                          special care must be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are adaptable'¿as long as they get
                          lots of quality time in their preferred lap.

                          With their spotted pink skin, spiky 'crested' hairdo, furry socks and feathery tail, you
                          can't mistake the sweet and slender Chinese Crested for any other breed. This frolicsome,
                          ultra-affectionate companion dog is truly a breed apart. The Chinese Crested, a lively and
                          alert toy breed standing between 11 and 13 inches high, can be hairless or coated. The
                          hairless variety has smooth, soft skin and tufts of hair on the head, tail, and ankles. The
                          coated variety, called the 'powderpuff, is covered by a soft, silky coat. Besides the coat,
                          there's very little difference between the powderpuff and his undressed brother. Both
                          varieties are characterized by fine-boned elegance and graceful movement. Cresteds are as fun
                          as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages:
                          there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn't much of a problem. Both
                          varieties are attentive housemates, totally in tune with their family.

                          This fascinating but challenging breed of ancient pedigree is steadfastly loyal to family, but
                          standoffish with strangers. The Chinese Shar-Pei has physical characteristics that make him a
                          one-of-a-kind companion and guardian dog. The compact, medium-sized Chinese Shar-Pei is an
                          amalgam of odd physical traits: a broad 'hippopotamus' muzzle; a blue-black tongue; small,
                          sunken eyes with a scowling expression; tiny triangular ears; abundant folds of loose skin
                          about the head, neck, and shoulders; the tapered high-set tail all blanketed by a harsh,
                          sandpapery coat. (A literal translation of Shar-Pei: 'sand skin'.) Shar-Pei are strong, regal,
                          independent guardians famous for intelligence and loyalty. They are suspicious of strangers
                          and other dogs. Shar-Pei are serene dogs, but they will meet a perceived threat with tenacity
                          and vigor. Early training and socialization are essential'¿a dominant adult Shar-Pei without
                          them is a serious problem waiting to happen.

                          The pride of Wonalancet, New Hampshire, the Chinook is a rugged working dog and devoted family
                          pet known for intelligence, patience, and eagerness to please. Once on the verge of
                          extinction, the Chinook is among the scarcest AKC breeds. Tawny-coated, no-frills Chinooks are
                          muscular and substantial, with males standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder. Females,
                          with their distinctly feminine look, are a bit smaller. Chinooks were conceived as
                          dual-purpose haulers, with the power of freighting dogs and the speed of sled racers. They are
                          the picture of stouthearted dignity, with a kindly twinkle in their dark, almond eyes.
                          Chinooks are calm, people-oriented dogs with a special feel for children. They are trainable
                          workers who aim to please. Sledding, carting, obedience, agility, search-and-rescue work, and
                          herding are a few pursuits they've mastered. Chinooks are not particularly busy dogs, but they
                          need consistent exercise to stay in proper hard condition.

                          The Chow Chow, an all-purpose dog of ancient China, presents the picture of a muscular,
                          deep-chested aristocrat with an air of inscrutable timelessness. Dignified, serious-minded,
                          and aloof, the Chow Chow is a breed of unique delights. Chows are powerful, compactly built
                          dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Their distinctive traits include a
                          lion's-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that
                          add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or
                          smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream. Owners say Chows are the cleanest of
                          dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as
                          cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified.
                          They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no
                          special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.

                          The sleek and sinewy Cirneco dell'Etna, the ancient coursing hound of Sicily, is an athletic
                          hunter given to quick bursts of speed. As housedogs, Cirnechi are mild, low-maintenance
                          companions cherished for their loyal and gentle nature. Standing under 20 inches, the Cirneco
                          ('cheer-NEK-o'; Cirnechi is the plural) is often described as resembling a smaller version of
                          the Pharaoh Hound, its cousin from the island of Malta. This slender but rugged hunter's coat
                          ranges from light to dark tan or chestnut. The large, upright ears point up the alert
                          expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat. In many ways,
                          these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of
                          course, breathtakingly swift. It is said, though, that Cirnechi are a bit more trainable than
                          the usual sighthound. These living artifacts of antiquity have sprinted into the 21st century
                          relatively unchanged by passing fads and fancies.

                          A dignified and mellow hunting companion of kings, the Clumber Spaniel is the largest of the
                          AKC flushing spaniels. For those who can handle some shedding and drooling, the amiable
                          Clumber is an amusing best friend and a gentlemanly housemate. Clumber Spaniels are powerful
                          bird dogs of heavy bone, built long and low, with a massive head. They stand 17 to 20 inches;
                          a small female might be 55 pounds, and a large male could go 85 pounds. Built to push through
                          thick cover in the field, Clumber movement is nonetheless free and easy. The dense coat is
                          primarily white, with sparse lemon or orange markings. Clumbers are sweet and easygoing at
                          home, but these outdoorsy fellows can be relentless on scent. Smart and eager-to-please
                          Clumbers respond well to training. Though a bit wary around strangers, Clumbers are friendly
                          dogs who bark only when they have something to say, and so make indifferent watchdogs. They
                          love swimming and fetching, and are sturdy childhood playmates.

                          The merry and frolicsome Cocker Spaniel, with his big, dreamy eyes and impish personality, is
                          one of the world's best-loved breeds. They were developed as hunting dogs, but Cockers gained
                          their wide popularity as all-around companions. Those big, dark eyes; that sweet expression;
                          those long, lush ears that practically demand to be touched'¿no wonder the Cocker spent years
                          as America's most popular breed. The Cocker is the AKC's smallest sporting spaniel, standing
                          about 14 to 15 inches. The coat comes in enough colors and patterns to please any taste. The
                          well-balanced body is sturdy and solid, and these quick, durable gundogs move with a smooth,
                          easy gait. Cockers are eager playmates for kids and are easily trained as companions and
                          athletes. They are big enough to be sporty, but compact enough to be portable. A Cocker in
                          full coat rewards extra grooming time by being the prettiest dog on the block. These energetic
                          sporting dogs love playtime and brisk walks.

                          variety, but there is also a sleek 'smooth' Collie. The Collie is a large but lithe herder
                          standing anywhere from 22 to 26 inches tall. The rough variety boasts one of the canine
                          kingdom's most impressively showy coats; the smooth coat's charms are subtler but no less
                          satisfying. Coat colors in both varieties are sable and white, tricolor, blue merle, or white.
                          Collie fanciers take pride in their breed's elegant wedge-shaped head, whose mobile ears and
                          almond eyes convey a wide variety of expressions. Collies are famously fond of children and
                          make wonderful family pets. These swift, athletic dogs thrive on companionship and regular
                          exercise. With gentle training, they learn happily and rapidly. The Collie's loyalty,
                          intelligence, and sterling character are the stuff of legend.

                          The Coton de Tulear, Royal Dog of Madagascar, is a bright, happy-go-lucky companion dog whose
                          favorite activities include clowning, cavorting, and following their special human around the
                          house. The Coton is small but robustly sturdy. The Coton de Tulear (KO-Tone Dih TOO-Lay-ARE)
                          is a small, immensely charming dog standing between 9 and 11 inches high and weighing anywhere
                          from 8 to 13 pounds. Cotons are known for a profuse white coat that is as soft as cotton (or,
                          as the French say, coton). Their primary job is to provide amusement, comfort, and
                          companionship. The bond between Cotons and their people is so tight that owners discuss it in
                          human terms. Coton fanciers describe them as witty companions at times boisterous but never
                          demanding and naturally clownish and lighthearted, who possess a 'remarkably gentle,
                          sympathetic awareness.' Amusing traits of these long-lived jesters include unique
                          vocalizations and a knack for walking on their hind legs.

                          The Croatian Sheepdog is an agile, helpful and humble shepherd dog, self-reliant to his owner,
                          brave and trustworthy. He is the true master of his flock, often running through the back of
                          the herd to get to the point of intervention as soon as possible.
                          Petar Horvat, the bishop of Djakovo, wrote in 1374 that Croats had brought a shepherd dog
                          along on the move to their new land. He referred to the dog as Canis Pastoralis Croaticus'the
                          Croatian Shepherd Dog. The bishop of Djakovo, Peter Bakic also wrote about the Croatian
                          Sheepdog in his 1719 manuscript 'On the Life of the People and Raising of Stock in Djakovo and
                          it's Surroundings in 1719'. He quoted the words written by Bishop Petar in 1374 and, providing
                          his own description of the dog, stated that the Croatian Sheepdog had not changed since the
                          record (from 1374 to 1719) and had not changed in appearance from that described by Bishop
                          Petar in 1374. A systematic selection breeding program was started by the "father of the
                          breed" - veterinarian Prof Dr Stjepan Romic in 1935 with dogs in the territory of Djakovo.
                          After 34 years of work, the breed was recognized by the FCI in 1969.

                          The Curly-Coated Retriever, among the oldest of the retriever breeds, is a famously versatile
                          gundog and peerless swimmer. Poised, proud, and wickedly smart, the Curly is a thinking
                          person's retriever who will never quit before you do. The Curly-Coated Retriever's tight,
                          crisp curls of either black or liver serve as waterproof and thorn-resistant all-weather gear
                          for work in thick bramble and icy lakes. The Curly is a big, durable gun dog, but more elegant
                          and graceful than other retrievers. Another trait that sets Curlies apart from the usual
                          retriever is a tapered, wedge-shaped head. Like Labradors and Goldens, Curlies are
                          affectionate and gentle, but they are a bit more independent and less needy. Playful and
                          mischievous with loved ones, Curlies can be aloof with strangers. This wariness makes them
                          more discerning watchdogs than other, more gregarious retrievers. These tireless dogs need
                          lots of outdoor exercise. Bored, underemployed Curlies are a handful.

                          An alert, primitive canine that resembles a wolf in appearance. They are highly intelligent,
                          powerful, active, loyal and devoted to it's owner. They have superior eyesight, hearing and
                          sense of smell and are known for having excellent stamina and endurance. The Czechoslovakian
                          Vlcak (CSV) was originally bred for working border patrol in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. They
                          are currently used in Europe and the United States for search and rescue, tracking, obedience,
                          agility, drafting, herding, and working dog sports. The CSV is bred for versatility and
                          hardiness in harsh elements and is much more independent in nature than many other working
                          breeds. They are an excellent choice for tracking or trailing sport/work, or as a companion
                          for active owners who enjoy spending time doing outdoor activities such as biking, running, or
                          hiking. They are not, however, recommended for first time owners.

                          the Dachshund have made him a superstar of the canine kingdom. Dachshunds come in two sizes
                          and in three coat types of various colors and patterns. The word 'icon' is terribly
                          overworked, but the Dachshund'¿with his unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big
                          personality'¿is truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16
                          to 32 pounds) or miniature (11 pounds or under), and come in one of three coat types: smooth,
                          wirehaired, or longhaired. Dachshunds aren't built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous
                          swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything. Smart and vigilant, with
                          a big-dog bark, they make fine watchdogs. Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey,
                          they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and
                          unique look has won millions of hearts the world over.

                          The dignified Dalmatian, dogdom's citizen of the world, is famed for his spotted coat and
                          unique job description. During their long history, these "coach dogs" have accompanied the
                          horse-drawn rigs of nobles, gypsies, and firefighters. The Dalmatian's delightful,
                          eye-catching spots of black or liver adorn one of the most distinctive coats in the animal
                          kingdom. Beneath the spots is a graceful, elegantly proportioned trotting dog standing between
                          19 and 23 inches at the shoulder. Dals are muscular, built to go the distance; the powerful
                          hindquarters provide the drive behind the smooth, effortless gait. The Dal was originally bred
                          to guard horses and coaches, and some of the old protective instinct remains. Reserved and
                          dignified, Dals can be aloof with strangers and are dependable watchdogs. With their preferred
                          humans, Dals are bright, loyal, and loving house dogs. They are strong, active athletes with
                          great stamina'¿a wonderful partner for runners and hikers.

                          The unique-looking Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a tough but dignified little exterminator.
                          Sturdily built for the rigors of farm life, they will agreeably adapt to city living. Dandies
                          are compact companions blessed with a big personality. Physical hallmarks of the Dandie
                          Dinmont Terrier include a large head covered with profuse, silky white hair; long, hanging
                          ears tipped with feathering and coming almost to a point; big, round eyes full of brightness
                          and expression; and a long, low torso and short legs. The crisp body coat comes in two spicy
                          colors: pepper (bluish black to silvery gray) and mustard (reddish brown to pale fawn).
                          Weighing no more than 24 pounds, Dandies are alert and intelligent watchdogs with a big
                          baritone bark. Dandies enjoy romping and cuddling with kids, but aren't as hyper as some small
                          dogs. They are terriers, though, with typical willfulness, independence, and courage. Dandie
                          owners get best results with positive, motivational training.

                          The Deutscher Wachtelhund has a scenting and blood tracking ability comparable to a Bloodhound
                          and can track 40-hour-old wounded game. On a fresh game trail, it must vocalize to inform
                          hunters of its location. They are a versatile breed, virtually unknown to the German
                          non-hunting public, and are only owned by hunters, gamekeepers, and professional hunters in
                          Germany.
                          The Deutscher Wachtelhund is a medium-sized, long-haired, very muscular gun dog with a noble
                          head and strong bone. Their keen hunting desire and ability make them an ideal dog for hunters
                          and because of their innate love of water, they are often used to hunt waterfowl. The
                          Deutscher Wachtelhund's name, German quail dog, relates to its ability as an upland bird
                          flusher and is also known as the German Spaniel.

                          fast, and powerful standing between 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder. The body is sleek but
                          substantial, and is covered with a glistening coat of black, blue, red, or fawn, with rust
                          markings. These elegant qualities, combined with a noble wedge-shaped head and an easy,
                          athletic way of moving, have earned Dobermans a reputation as royalty in the canine kingdom. A

                          The Dogo Argentino is a pack-hunting dog, bred for the pursuit of big-game such as wild boar
                          and puma, and possesses the strength, intelligence and quick responsiveness of a serious
                          athlete. His short, plain and smooth coat is completely white, but a dark patch near the eye
                          is permitted as long as it doesn't cover more than 10% of the head. The ideal Dogo Argentino
                          is a study in harmony. He is large, powerful, and athletic. His strong head is supported by
                          a thick, but elegant neck that connects to a balanced body, which is sustained by straight,
                          substantial forelegs and very muscular, medium-angulated hindquarters. The Dogo gives the
                          impression of explosive power and energy. Developed to find, chase and catch dangerous game
                          the Dogo must have a good nose, great lung capacity, and a powerful, yet agile, muscular
                          build. His expression is alert and intelligent, with a marked hardness. The Dogo is
                          instantly identifiable by his short, completely white coat.

                          courage are famously loyal, affectionate, and protective. The Dogue de Bordeaux is an
                          immensely powerful mastiff-type guardian. Males can go 27 inches high and 110 pounds. The
                          short, eye-catching coat is a richly colored fawn. The massive head features a
                          Bulldog-like undershot jaw, expressive eyes, and a deeply furrowed brow. It is,
                          proportionately, the largest head in the canine kingdom. The body is stocky and close to
                          the ground, but Dogues can move like lions when duty calls. DDBs of proper temperament are
                          sweet and sensitive souls. Owners appreciate their breed's loyalty to loved ones of all
                          ages, but also say DDBs can be stubborn and will dominate those who fail to apply firm
                          training in puppyhood. When acquiring such a strapping super-dog, finding a responsible
                          breeder is key.

                          This breed is pronounced da'rinse-ah puh'trice-hoon. The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent
                          for short, is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail
                          and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a
                          farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin,
                          cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the
                          beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept
                          lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog
                          sledding, and skijoring.
                          The breed developed from pointing dogs originating in Spain (Spioenen) and arrived in
                          The Netherlands via France in the 16th Century. In The Netherlands, these dogs were
                          referred to as Partridge dogs. In the Province of Drenthe, these Partridge dogs were
                          bred among themselves and not mixed with foreign breeds, as occurred elsewhere.
                          Throughout the Drents history, the breed stood on three equally important pillars:
                          versatile hunting dog, farmyard dog, and playmate to the children. It is fundamental to
                          the Drent breed that he hunts all upland game and waterfowl, announces visitors to the
                          home or farm (without showing aggression or fear), and is an excellent family companion.
                          The Drent is used to hunt a variety of terrain and game. His adaptability makes him
                          suitable for all manner of game in the field as well as waterfowl. Moreover, his work
                          after the shot is exceptional, and he is a good retriever. These characteristics are
                          innate, and the dog therefore needs little field training. Due to the dog's soft nature
                          forceful training methods are inappropriate. The dog is expected to bark to announce
                          visitors to the home and is often reserved towards strangers until the owner welcomes
                          them, meaning the Drent may be shy in the beginning but never fearful. The dog is loyal
                          and intelligent and, with proper upbringing, a pet of exceptional value on top of being
                          a good hunting buddy.

                          The Drever is robust and strong rather than elegant and speedy. They have a proud
                          carriage, well-developed muscles and agile appearance. Affectionate, playful, and
                          sweet, the Drever gets along well with most other breeds and is great in groups. The
                          Drever was developed in the early twentieth century in Sweden. Hunting deer was
                          difficult due to terrain and herd locations so hunters soon realized the benefits of
                          using this short-legged, long-bodied dog to drive the deer over long distances and
                          rough terrain right to them. A keen and even-tempered hound, the Drever is never
                          aggressive, nervous or shy. They are content in most living situations, but tend to be
                          vocal when alerting or at play.

                          The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its
                          herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can
                          be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep
                          flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in
                          its physique and structure. The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring
                          shepherd's dog living in rural areas. It was developed as an all-purpose farm dog, working
                          originally as a farm guard, drover, and livestock dog. A well known dog fancier wrote about
                          the Dutch Shepherd in 1910: "...bearing a great resemblance to the wolf." Of course this is
                          not entirely true, but it is another aspect that shows that the Dutch Shepherd still has many
                          of the characteristics of its wild forebears. Although it is not a widely known breed, the
                          Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports,
                          herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog.

                          English Cocker Spaniel lovers often use the word 'merry' to describe their breed. Upbeat in
                          the field and mellow at home, this compact, silky-coated bird dog is widely admired for his
                          delightful personality and irresistible good looks.
                          The English Cocker Spaniel is a compactly built sporting dog standing between 15 to 17
                          inches at the shoulder. The softly contoured head, with its dark, melting eyes that convey
                          an alert and dignified expression, is framed by lush, close-lying ears. The medium-length
                          coat, seen in a variety of striking colors and patterns, is silky to the touch. 'Balance' is
                          a key word in understanding the breed: The EC is balanced in temperament, construction, and
                          movement. Beneath the EC's physical beauty beats the heart of a tireless, eager-to-please
                          hunter's helper, famous the world over for his ability to flush and retrieve gamebirds. For
                          those who prefer more domestic pursuits, there is no more charming and agreeable household
                          companion.

                          The English Foxhound is a substantial galloping hound of great stamina. His long legs are
                          straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy. The back is perfectly level. And the chest is
                          very deep, 'girthing' as much as 31 inches on a hound measuring 24 inches at the shoulder,
                          ensuring plenty of lung power for a grueling day's hunt. These pack-oriented, scent-driven
                          hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a
                          primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning
                          these noble creatures is best left to huntsmen who kennel packs of hounds or to those
                          experienced in meeting the special challenges of life with swift, powerful hounds hardwired
                          for the chase. The English Foxhound is the epitome of what serious dog breeders strive for:
                          beauty, balance, and utility. The long legs are straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy.

                          grace and strength as in a fine Foxhound.'

                          The English Setter is a medium-sized sporting dog of sweet temper and show-stopping good
                          looks. It is one of the AKC's four British setters created to work on the distinctly
                          different terrains of England, Ireland, and Scotland. English Setters are elegant but solid
                          dogs of beauty and charm. The word 'belton' unique to the breed, describes the speckled
                          coat patterns of colors that sound good enough to eat: liver, lemon, and orange among them.
                          Under the showy coat is a well-balanced hunter standing about 25 inches at the shoulder. A
                          graceful neck carries a long, oval-shaped head proudly, and dark brown eyes convey a soft
                          expression. The merry English Setter is known as the gentleman of the dog world but is game
                          and boisterous at play. English Setters get on well with other dogs and people. A veteran
                          all-breed dog handler says, 'As a breed to share one's life and living space with, no other
                          breed gives me more pleasure than the English Setter.'

                          The English Springer Spaniel is a sweet-faced, lovable bird dog of great energy, stamina,
                          and brains. Sport hunters cherish the duality of working Springers: handsome, mannerly pets
                          during the week, and trusty hunting buddies on weekends. Built for long days in the field,
                          English Springer Spaniels are tough, muscular hunters standing 19 to 20 inches at the
                          shoulder and weighing between 40 and 50 pounds. The double coat comes in several colors and
                          patterns, the ears are long and lush, and the kindly, trusting expression of the eyes is a
                          cherished hallmark of the breed. Springers move with a smooth, ground-covering stride. Bred
                          to work closely with humans, Springers are highly trainable people-pleasers. They crave
                          company and are miserable when neglected. Polite dogs, Springers are good with kids and
                          their fellow mammals. They are eager to join in any family activity. Long walks, games of
                          chase and fetch, and swimming are favorite pastimes of these rugged spaniels.

                          The merry English Toy Spaniel was bred to be the companion of kings. But ETS are spaniels
                          first and pampered lapdogs second, and beneath the patrician exterior beats the heart of a
                          real doggy dog-bright, loving, and willing to please.
                          The ETS is a square, snub-nosed toy weighing no more than 14 pounds. The large domed
                          head-with its long and lush ears, dark melting eyes, and chubby cheeks-is a famous breed
                          trait. The profuse coat comes in four varieties, each with its own proper name: red and
                          white (Blenheim); black and tan (King Charles); white, black, and tan (Prince Charles); and
                          a solid red (Ruby). Blenheims often have a red mark, the 'Blenheim Spot,' on top of the
                          head. The ETS, like many toy breeds kept by royals, came to assume the personalities of
                          their aristocratic owners. They can be proud and willful, and extremely discriminating in
                          their choice of friends. With their favored humans, they are affectionate at home and
                          exuberant and curious at play.

                          The Entlebucher Mountain Dog, tricolor 'Laughing Dog' of the Swiss Alps, is a rugged and
                          determined mover of cattle. These spirited, energetic workers and athletes are independent
                          problem solvers and are happiest with a job to perform. Entlebucher (ENT-leh-boo-cur)
                          Mountain Dogs are muscular, long-backed cattle dogs standing from 16 to 21 inches at the
                          shoulder. They have short, sturdy legs; a striking black, white, and tan coat; and an
                          attentive, friendly face. Entles are famous for their agility, balance, and boundless
                          enthusiasm. Entles are vigilant protectors of their four- or two-legged 'herds' and, when
                          properly socialized, make durable and trustworthy playmates for older kids. Energetic Entles
                          require lots of exercise, family time, and direction to reach their full potential.
                          Inexperienced owners might be overwhelmed by this strong, self-confident, go-go herding dog
                          eager for work. Entlebuchers are fine dogs'clever, zesty, happy'¿but not for everyone.

                          The Estrela Mountain Dog is not only an excellent livestock guardian, but is also known for
                          his love of children and family. Proper socialization and training as a puppy is very
                          important so that the dominance in the Estrela's personality does not become aggressive. The
                          Estrela Mountain Dog is named for the Estrela Mountains in Portugal and is believed to be
                          the oldest breed in the region. The breed has several distinctive physical characteristics
                          including rosed ears, a black mask and a hook at the end of its tail. He is an inseparable
                          companion of the shepherd and a faithful flock guardian, bravely protecting it against
                          predators and thieves. A wonderful farm and house guard, he is distrustful towards strangers
                          but typically docile to his master. As a companion in the home, an Estrela will bond for
                          life. He will love and protect his whole family, but a piece of his soul will belong to that
                          one special family member of his choosing. As an Estrela owner tells us: "There is nothing
                          compared to the love of an Estrela."

                          The Eurasier is a medium-sized dog with a thick, medium-long coat that can come in a variety
                          of colors. Confident, calm, and well-balanced, he is loyal to the entire family, but
                          reserved towards strangers. He must live in close contact with his family, as he is not
                          suited to be kept in kennels or tied up outside. The Eurasier comes in a beautiful array of
                          colors. All coat colors are permitted as per the breed standard except for liver color, pure
                          white and irregular white patches. Eurasiers can have purple tongues, pink tongues or
                          spotted tongues. They can also have dark face masks or light, so-called reverse masks.
                          Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered, gentle, loving, intelligent and confident.

                          The sweet and sensitive Field Spaniel is famously docile, but vigorous and game for anything
                          when at play or in the field. These close cousins to Cocker Spaniels and Springer Spaniels may
                          be small in number, but their charm is enormous.
                          Field Spaniels bear a family resemblance to Cocker, Springer, and Sussex spaniels. The
                          distinctive glossy coat is either black, some shade of liver, or combinations of the two. They
                          stand 17 or 18 inches at the shoulder and should present the picture of well-balanced,
                          moderately proportioned hunting companions. The long, feathery ears frame a facial expression
                          conveying a grave, gentle intelligence. Field Spaniels are sweet, sensitive souls with just
                          enough independence to make life interesting. They are trustworthy with kids, tolerant of
                          their fellow mammals, and responsive to training. The U.S. breed standard calls these tranquil
                          house dogs 'unusually docile,' but they are nonetheless playful and enjoy a good backyard
                          romp.

                          The weatherproof Finnish Lapphund is a tough and substantial reindeer herder from north of the
                          Arctic Circle. This remarkably empathetic breed is among the friendliest of all dogs'¿once
                          he's satisfied that you aren't a reindeer rustler. Finnish Lapphunds, with their luscious
                          coat, sweet spitz-like face, and profusely coated tail that curves over the back, are
                          instantly recognizable as Nordic dogs. Lappies stand about 20 inches at the shoulder and are
                          surprisingly muscular and substantial for their inches. Quick and agile, they move
                          effortlessly and can go from a trot to a full gallop in a second flat. Lappies are friendly
                          and submissive companions, though a bit wary of strangers. They crave companionship and will
                          be miserable when neglected. A distinctive breed trait is a strong 'startle reflex,' the
                          result of centuries spent ducking the antlers of ornery reindeer. Despite their propensity for
                          shedding and barking, Lappies are popular pets in their homeland.

                          The lively Finnish Spitz, the flame-colored, foxy-faced breed from the 'Land of 60,000 Lakes,'
                          is a small but fearless hunting dog whose unique style of tracking and indicating quarry has
                          earned him the nickname the 'Barking Bird Dog.' The balanced, squarely symmetrical Finnish
                          Spitz will stand not more than 20 inches at the shoulder and are easily recognized by their
                          foxy face and prick ears projecting a lively expression, and a curving plumed tail. Their
                          dense coat of glorious golden-red which is never monochromatic gives them the Finnish Spitz
                          'Glow.' Finkies or Finns, as they are nicknamed, move with a bold and brisk gait. Finkies make
                          excellent alertdogs, wary but not shy with strangers. This is a vocal breed in Finland, owners
                          hold contests to crown a 'King Barker' and true Finn lovers are more delighted than annoyed by
                          their breed's yodeling and range of vocalization. Finkies are eager canine athletes and
                          eye-catching show dogs known to be smart, sensitive, and captivating companions.

                          The Peter Pan of the Sporting Group, the forever-young Flat-Coated Retriever is a gundog of
                          relatively recent origin. Happy, self-assured, and willing to please, a good Flat-Coat will
                          retrieve a duck or a show ribbon with equal aplomb. The Flat-Coated Retriever's eponymous
                          flat-lying coat comes in lustrous black or liver, with feathering at the legs and tail. A
                          distinctive breed hallmark is the long head unique among retrievers which projects a smart and
                          kindly expression. A Flat-Coat will stand as tall as a Labrador Retriever, but in silhouette
                          they present a leaner, more elegant look. Dogdom's champion tail-waggers, Flat-Coats are among
                          the happiest of all breeds. They mature slowly; some owners say that they never grow up at
                          all, retaining a puppyish taste for rambunctious mischief into old age. This can be either
                          delightful or exasperating, depending on your tolerance for such monkeyshines. This highly
                          energetic breed requires lots of outdoorsy exercise.

                          The one-of-a-kind French Bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the
                          world's most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers. The Frenchie is
                          playful, alert, adaptable, and completely irresistible. The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog
                          in miniature, except for the large, erect 'bat ears' that are the breed's trademark feature.
                          The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The
                          body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular. The bright, affectionate
                          Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don't bark much'¿but their alertness makes
                          them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and
                          do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making
                          new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by
                          this vastly amusing and companionable breed.

                          A good way to describe the German Longhaired Pointer is that, in appearance, it's Continental
                          Europe's version of a Setter: a pointing dog with full tail and a long coat with dense guard
                          hairs and a moderate undercoat. One noteworthy difference is the GLP's affection for swimming
                          and, therefore, waterfowl hunting. Coat color reflects the mixture of markings similar to a
                          German Shorthaired Pointer.
                          German Longhaired Pointers are a gun dog and as such, they are expected to search, point,
                          track and retrieve game. They can excel in all types of hunting situations: waterfowl hunting,
                          searching for upland game birds, or retrieving furred game in the woods or prairies, typically
                          rabbit and squirrel in North America. They have a unique ability in being able to switch from
                          a calm household pet to a fiery, passionate hunter. Having been bred for hunting for over a
                          century, they are a superior, tried and tested hunting companion.

                          The sleek, no-frills German Pinscher is among Germany's oldest breeds and the prototype of
                          other pinscher breeds. This energetic, super-intelligent dog was at first used as a rat
                          catcher but can be trained for all types of canine work.
                          Sleek, shiny, and streamlined, GPs are a true dog lover's delight. They're eye-catching and
                          elegant but in all ways honestly doggy's nothing fussy or exaggerated. They'll stand about
                          knee-high to the average adult. Muscles ripple beneath a shimmering coat of red, black or blue
                          with red accents. There's nobility in the elongated, wedge-shaped head, and the dark eyes are
                          alert and eager. GPs move with the kind of strong, free-and-easy gait that tells you this is a
                          confident companion, up for anything the day might bring.

                          Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large,
                          agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous,
                          and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand
                          as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of
                          smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they
                          can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German
                          Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute
                          is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and
                          the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will
                          be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a
                          'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'

                          The versatile, medium-sized German Shorthaired Pointer is an enthusiastic gundog of all trades
                          who thrives on vigorous exercise, positive training, and a lot of love. GSP people call their
                          aristocratic companions the perfect pointer. Male German Shorthaired Pointers stand between 23
                          and 25 inches at the shoulder and weigh anywhere from 55 to 70 pounds; females run smaller.
                          The coat is solid liver (a reddish brown), or liver and white in distinctive patterns. The
                          dark eyes shine with enthusiasm and friendliness. Built to work long days in the field or at
                          the lake, GSPs are known for power, speed, agility, and endurance. Noble and aristocratic are
                          words often used to describe the overall look. GSPs make happy, trainable pets who bond firmly
                          to their family. They are always up for physical activities like running, swimming, organized
                          dog sports in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending
                          outdoors time with a human buddy.

                          The German Spitz is always attentive, lively and exceptionally devoted to his owner. He is
                          very teachable and easy to train. His distrust towards strangers and lack of hunting instinct
                          make him the ideal watchdog for the home. His indifference to weather, robustness and
                          longevity are his most outstanding attributes.
                          Spitz breeds like the German Spitz are captivating on account of their beautiful coats, made
                          to stand off by a plentiful undercoat. Particularly impressive is his strong, mane-like collar
                          around his neck, called a ruff, and the bushy tail carried boldly over his back. His foxy
                          head, alert eyes, and small, pointed, closely-set ears give the German Spitz his unique cheeky
                          appearance. The Large German Spitz comes in white, black or brown. The toy and medium German
                          Spitz come in a variety of colors including white, black, brown, orange, grey-shaded and other
                          colors. Though easily trainable, this lively and intelligent breed can also have an
                          independent streak. If properly trained (so as not to be too noisy) and well socialized, the
                          German Spitz will be happy mingling with other people and dogs.

                          With his sporty weatherproof coat and can-do attitude, the noble German Wirehaired Pointer is
                          a versatile, sturdy gundog who thrives on outdoor activity. Around the house, the GWP is an
                          eager, affectionate, and amusing family companion. Standing as high as 26 inches at the
                          shoulder, GWPs are a bit taller and heavier than their close relative, the German Shorthaired
                          Pointer. GWPs are balanced, well muscled, resilient, agile, and generally built to beat the
                          bushes all day long without tiring. The harsh wire coat protects against thorny underbrush and
                          foul weather, and the shaggy beard and eyebrows complete an intelligent, worldly expression.
                          The need for running in the great outdoors is a must! says one veteran owner. This breed will
                          not be happy to be on the couch all day. GWPs are bright and eager, but their independent,
                          inquisitive nature might frustrate novice owners. A good fit for those looking for a loving
                          companion who enjoys sports and togetherness.

                          The Giant Schnauzer is a larger and more powerful version of the Standard Schnauzer, and he
                          should, as the breed standard says, "be a bold and valiant figure of a dog." Great
                          intelligence and loyalty make him a stellar worker and companion.
                          A well-bred Giant Schnauzer closely resembles the Standard Schnauzer, only bigger. As their
                          name suggests, Giants are imposing. A male might stand as high as 27.5 inches at the shoulder
                          and weigh 95 pounds. The muscular, substantial body is, as the breed's fanciers put it, a
                          "bold and valiant figure of a dog." The double coat is either solid black or "pepper and
                          salt." Familiar characteristics of the Mini, Standard, and Giant are a harsh beard and
                          eyebrows, accentuating a keen, sagacious expression.

                          Gentler, less excitable than most terriers, but still bold and spirited, the double-coated
                          Glen of Imaal Terrier is named for one of Ireland's most remote locales. The brave but docile
                          Glen is a strong, no-fuss dog built for hard work. Glens are scruffy, sturdy, low-slung
                          terriers standing no more than 14 inches at the shoulder. There's nothing fancy or fussed-over
                          about Glens. Rather, their wiry no-frills coat, broad head, and bowed front legs suggest a
                          working farm dog from a time and place where substance was more important than style. And yet,
                          they're also ridiculously cute. It takes a heart of stone to resist reaching down to give a
                          Glen a scratch behind the ear and a pat on the well-muscled rump.

                          The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's
                          most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the
                          blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an
                          endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of
                          medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The
                          broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a
                          breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is
                          carried, as breed fanciers say, with a action. The most complete records of the development of
                          the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about
                          1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at
                          Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in
                          1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and
                          sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual
                          confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are
                          outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They
                          take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood.
                          These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl
                          for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.

                          The Gordon Setter, the black avenger of the Highlands, is a substantial bird dog named for a
                          Scottish aristocrat. Athletic and outdoorsy, Gordons are bold, confident, and resolute in the
                          field, and sweetly affectionate by the fireside. Gordons are the largest and most substantial
                          of setters a big male might stand 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 80 pounds. The stunning
                          coat is a glistening black, with tan markings and long hair on the ears, belly, legs, chest,
                          and tail. Tan spots above the bright brown eyes point up a wise and willing expression. Like
                          other Scots breeds, from the compact Scottish Terrier to the majestic Scottish Deerhound,
                          Gordons were built to withstand their homeland's tough terrain and foul weather.

                          The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is a French scenthound. Somewhat active and never
                          high-strung, yet GBGVs are busy dogs who don't tire easily. First, let's deal with the name.
                          Roughly translated, it means Large, low, shaggy dog of the VendÃ©e and is pronounced
                          Grand-Bah-SAY Gree-FOHN VON-day-uhn. Now, let's have a look at the dog: He's a sweet-faced,
                          long-eared fellow in a shaggy coat whose mustache, beard, and profuse eyebrows suggest the
                          look of a worldly but amiable Frenchman. Beneath the Grand's Old World charm is a rugged,
                          sturdily-built bruiser who is deceptively quick and light-footed. The stamina and courage of
                          these longer-than-tall hunters is the stuff of Gallic legend.

                          The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty "Apollo of Dogs," is a total joy to live with, but owning
                          a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength is a commitment not to be entered into
                          lightly. This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane.
                          As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs and when standing on
                          their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of
                          elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in
                          different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork
                          pattern known as "harlequin." Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just
                          the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those
                          foolish enough to mistake the breed's friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of
                          true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily.

                          The Great Pyrenees is a large, thickly coated, and immensely powerful working dog bred to
                          deter sheep-stealing wolves and other predators on snowy mountaintops. Pyrs today are mellow
                          companions and vigilant guardians of home and family. Frequently described as majestic, Pyrs
                          are big, immensely strong mountain dogs standing as high as 32 inches at the shoulder and
                          often tipping the scales at more than 100 pounds. These steadfast guardians usually exhibit a
                          Zen-like calm, but they can quickly spring into action and move with grace and speed to meet a
                          threat. The lush weatherproof coat is all white, or white with markings of beautiful shades of
                          gray, tan, reddish-brown, or badger.

                          The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large, immensely strong worker famous for a dense coat of
                          striking black, red, and white markings. Dependable and faithful Swissies earned their feed as
                          herders, drafters, and all-around pasture dogs.
                          Greater than what? Well, standing as high as 28.5 inches and weighing as much as a midsize
                          human, a Greater Swiss might easily be greater than you. Swissies are immensely strong, yet
                          agile enough to move a flock across the sloping foot of a mountain. The coat is a striking
                          tricolor, black, red, and white. The head and muzzle typically have a white marking (the
                          "blaze"), setting off a sweet expression. Several big mountain-dog breeds are described as
                          majestic, but Swissies practically invented the word.

                          The champion sprinter of dogdom, the Greyhound is a gentle, noble, and sweet-tempered
                          companion with an independent spirit. For thousands of years these graceful hounds have been
                          an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings. Greyhounds are the essence of the dog
                          breeder's credo Form follows function. From the narrow, aerodynamic skull to the
                          shock-absorbing pads of the feet, Greyhounds are perfectly constructed for high-speed pursuit.
                          The lean beauty of the Greyhound inverted S shape, created by the deep chest curving gently
                          into a tightly tucked waist, has been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings
                          for as long as human beings have called themselves civilized. Greyhounds are the template from
                          which other coursing hounds have been struck.

                          The Hamiltonstovare is a versatile scent hound, bred to hunt hare and fox in Sweden. When not
                          hunting, they can be found in the show ring, as their striking color makes them a stunning
                          show dog. Hamiltons have been used as service dogs in America since the late 90's, where their
                          versatility and close bond with their people shine.
                          Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets,
                          all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it
                          goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with
                          this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey
                          drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they
                          are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to
                          train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not
                          usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one
                          breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States. Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue
                          problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North
                          Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee.

                          The Hanoverian Scenthound has a calm and assured temperament, at the same time sensitive with
                          his handler, and choosy and discerning with strangers. He has high capabilities of
                          concentration in any tracking work with strong loyalty to the hunter in charge.
                          Hailing from Germany, the Hanoverian Scenthound is the Hannoverscher Schweihund in its native
                          language. In general appearance, the highly efficient Hanoverian is of medium-large size, well
                          proportioned and powerful. Well set strongly muscled fore and hind limbs qualify him for
                          tireless work. His broad, deep chest provides ample room for the lungs and enables long,
                          strenuous chases. The slightly wrinkled forehead and the clear, dark eyes produce the serious
                          expression typical of the Hanoverian Scenthound. Also typical for the breed is the red primary
                          color of the coat, which can vary from a pale fawn color to a dark brindle, appearing almost
                          black.

                          The Harrier is a swift, prey-driven pack hound of medium size first bred in medieval England
                          to chase the hare. Outgoing and friendly, the Harrier is much larger than the Beagle but
                          smaller than another close relative, the English Foxhound.
                          Somewhat resembling a Beagle with a gym membership, Harriers are larger, more powerful hounds
                          than their diminutive cousin' but smaller than the English Foxhound, a breed used in their
                          development. Standing between 19 and 21 inches at the shoulder, Harriers have the timeless
                          look of a working pack hound: a short, smart-looking coat; low-set, velvety ears; an
                          irresistibly sweet face; and enough muscle and sinew to endure a long day's hunt. A well-built
                          Harrier will cover the ground with a smooth, efficient gait.

                          Havanese, the only dog breed native to Cuba, are cheerful little dogs with a spring in their
                          step and a gleam in their big, brown eyes. These vivacious and sociable companions are
                          becoming especially popular with American city dwellers. Distinctive features of the Havanese
                          include a curled-over tail and a gorgeous silky coat, which comes in a variety of colors. Some
                          owners enjoy cording the coat, in the manner of a Puli, and others clip it short to reduce
                          grooming time. Happily, Havenese are just as cute no matter what hairdo you give them. Their
                          small but sturdy bodies, adaptable nature, and social skills make Havanese an ideal city dog,
                          but they are content to be anywhere that they can command the attention of admirers young and
                          old alike. Havanese, smart and trainable extroverts with the comic instincts of a born clown,
                          are natural trick dogs. Havanese are also excellent watchdogs and take the job seriously, but
                          will usually keep the barking to a minimum.

                          The Hokkaido is a dog of noteworthy endurance and dignity. His temperament is faithful,
                          docile, very alert and bold. He also shows accurate judgement and great stamina.
                          The Hokkaido is a medium-sized, strongly-built dog. They have longer, thicker coats than the
                          other Japanese breeds, and also have wider chests and smaller ears. Like all the Nihon Ken,
                          they have a double coat made up of protective, coarse outer guard hairs, and a fine, thick
                          undercoat that is shed seasonally. The breed comes in several colors: white, red, black,
                          brindle, sesame, and wolf grey. With early training, the Hokkaido is a very loyal and
                          dedicated companion who wants to please his human family. They are incredibly intelligent
                          thinkers and problem solvers, and they excel at tasks given to them. If not socialized
                          properly, however, Hokkaido can become wary of strangers and protective of their families. The
                          breed is extremely rare outside its native country. In Japan, there is an estimated population
                          of around 10,000-12,000, and yearly registrations of between 900-1000.

                          The Hovawart is a medium-temperament working dog with versatile usage and has a very good
                          nose. He is kind, has an even disposition and protective instinct, is self-confident and has
                          the ability to take stress. His balanced body proportions and special devotion to his family
                          make him an outstanding companion, watch, guard, tracking and rescue-dog. Physically,
                          Hovawarts are large, heavy-boned dogs that have been bred to be intelligent guardians of
                          livestock and the home. They come in three colors: blonde, black and tan, and black. They are
                          alert, faithful, trustworthy, extremely intelligent, fun-loving, and stubborn. A Hovawart
                          likes to have a job to do, or he will use his creative nature to find one. They take
                          approximately two years to mature. Currently, Hovawarts in North America are participating in
                          search and rescue organizations, therapy dog activities, obedience trials, agility trials,
                          flyball and service dog training. Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require
                          significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time
                          dog owners. However, for an owner who is willing to expend the effort to teach their dog
                          appropriate behaviors in different situations, the reward is a faithful companion. The
                          Hovawart is a family dog. It develops a strong bond to its pack and must be a part of the
                          family life; it needs to bond closely with the owner/family. If it has been well integrated
                          into the family, it does not mind spending the occasional hour in a kennel.

                          The Ibizan Hound is a lithe and leggy visitor from the dawn of civilization, bred as a rabbit
                          courser on the rocky shores of Spain's Balearic Islands. World-class sprinters and leapers,
                          Ibizans need ample space to air out their engines.
                          Ibizans are lithe and leggy visitors from the dawn of civilization. Art history students will
                          recognize the elongated head, with its large erect ears, as a familiar motif of ancient Egypt.
                          The elegant, racy body stands 22.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder, with coat colors of solid
                          red or white, or red and white patterns. The rosy-colored leathers of the nose, eye rims, and
                          lips, along with amber or caramel eyes, perfectly complement the coat. The breed's quiet grace
                          is often described as deer-like.

                          The Icelandic Sheepdog, Iceland's only native dog breed, is a charmingly friendly and faithful
                          all-around herder of small-to-medium size. A densely coated Nordic spitz-type breed,
                          Icelandics are enthusiastically devoted to their humans.
                          Icelandics are one of the 50 or so northern breeds from around the world classified as
                          spitzes. The breed's "spitziness" is expressed by a dense coat, foxy face, pointed ears, and a
                          bushy, curling tail. Icelandics, standing no higher than 18 inches at the shoulder, are just
                          under what we'd consider medium sized. They come in several predominant colors, always
                          accompanied by white markings. An endearing trait is the facial expression: friendly, happy,
                          always looking as though there's no place they'd rather be than with you.

                          The rollicking Irish Red and White Setter is an athletic medium-sized bird dog bred primarily
                          for hunting. Fun-loving, friendly, and high-spirited, Irish Red and Whites are a bit shorter
                          and stockier than their cousin the Irish Setter.
                          Sportsmen thrill at the sight of a noble Red and White frozen on point, motionless as a
                          statue. These medium-to-large bird dogs are powerful, solid, and sinewy, with enough stamina
                          and bird sense to get the job done any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The stunning coat,
                          vivid red islands floating on a sea of pearl white, has a practical function: It enables
                          hunters to spot their dog at a distance. The handsome face projects a keen but kindly
                          expression.

                          The Irish Setter is a high-spirited gundog known for grace, swiftness, and a flashy red coat.
                          They are famously good family dogs: sweet-tempered companions for the folks, and rollicking
                          playmates and tennis-ball fetchers for the children. The Irish Setter has been described by
                          its partisans as the most beautiful of dog breeds. Standing more than two feet at the
                          shoulder, with a substantial yet elegant build, the Irish is famed for a brilliant coat of
                          mahogany or chestnut. Long, sinewy legs and powerful rear drive help to place the Irish among
                          the swiftest of all sporting dogs. The Irish Setter's lovable personality has endeared the
                          breed to sportsmen and pet owners for more than 200 years. Irish are outgoing dogs who enjoy
                          making friends. These rambunctious redheads are big kids at heart, but they are eager to
                          please and will respond to patient, positive training. They are said to be bold and rugged
                          hunting partners, with a devil-may-care approach to their work.

                          The Irish Terrier, 'Daredevil' of the Emerald Isle, is a bold, dashing, and courageous terrier
                          of medium size. Known for his fiery red coat and a temperament to match, the Irish Terrier is
                          stouthearted at work and tenderhearted at home. Irish Terriers are the prototype of a
                          long-legged terrier. Standing about 18 inches at the shoulder, they're sturdy but lithe and
                          graceful. Every line of the body is eye-catching, and the overall picture is beautifully
                          balanced. The tight red coat is as fiery as the breed's temperament. ITs are a dog lover's
                          delight: If your heart doesn't go pitty-pat at the sight of this Technicolor terrier framed
                          against the vivid greens of the Irish countryside, forget dogs and buy a goldfish.

                          The tallest of the AKC's spaniels, the Irish Water Spaniel is instantly recognizable by its

                          and inquisitive IWS is hardworking and brave in the field, and playfully affectionate at home.
                          This tallest of AKC spaniels, standing 21 to 24 inches at the shoulder and weighing 55 to 65
                          pounds, straddles the line between medium and large dogs on our scale of size. Among its
                          distinguishing characteristics are a crisply curled, liver-colored, waterproof coat; a tapered
                          'rat tail'; and a cleanly chiseled head crowned with a topknot of long, loose curls. The IWS
                          moves with a smooth ground-covering gait, enabling him to put in a long day's work in the

                          The calm, dignified, and kindly Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all AKC breeds. Once
                          fearless big-game hunters capable of dispatching a wolf in single combat, Wolfhounds today are
                          the most serene and agreeable of companions.
                          The amiable Irish Wolfhound is an immense, muscular hound gracefully built along classic
                          Greyhound lines, capable of great speed at the gallop. A male might stand nearly 3 feet at the
                          shoulder and weigh up to 180 pounds. Females will run smaller but are still a whole lot of
                          hound. The rough, hard coat comes in many colors, including white, gray, brindle, red, black,
                          and fawn. IWs are too serene to be fierce guard dogs, but just the sight of them is enough to
                          deter intruders. IWs are characteristically patient with kids, though animals their size
                          should be supervised around small children. Owning an Irish Wolfhound is a unique, rewarding
                          experience'¿but acquiring a giant galloping hound is a commitment as big as the dog itself.

                          A true Greyhound in miniature, the elegant Italian Greyhound is an alert, playful, and highly
                          affectionate toy companion. IGs make decorative couch dogs, but at heart they are
                          flash-and-dash coursing hounds with an instinct for pursuit. IGs are Greyhounds in miniature
                          more slender, but a Greyhound's equal in grace and elegance. Standing ideally 13 to 15 inches
                          at the shoulder, they present the sleek, curving lines common to all coursing hounds.
                          Distinguishing features are the long, fine-boned legs. IGs combine the attentiveness of
                          lapdogs with the complexity of ancient, aristocratic hounds. Bred for centuries to be doting
                          companions and jesters, these high-stepping charmers refuse to be ignored. On the whole,
                          writes an IG expert, the breed would much rather be in your lap or bed than on the floor. They
                          are, though, true sighthounds and will bolt after quick-moving prey at the drop of a cat. A
                          short-coat, low-fat breed, IGs require extra care in cold weather

                          He is particularly suited to hunting under the ground and as a flushing dog and is relatively
                          small, compact, and well-proportioned. His dense coat, either hard and rough or course and
                          smooth, is usually black and tan, but can be dark brown or grayish-black as well. The tan
                          markings are on his eyebrows, muzzle, chest, legs, and at the base of his tail. He could also
                          have small white markings on his chest and toes.

                          The Japanese Chin is a charming toy companion of silky, profuse coat and an unmistakably
                          aristocratic bearing. Often described as a distinctly feline breed, this bright and amusing
                          lapdog is fastidious, graceful, and generally quiet. Chin are the unrivaled noblemen of
                          Japanese breeds. They're tiny indoorsy companions, with an unmistakably Eastern look and
                          bearing. The head is large, the muzzle short, and the round, dark eyes convey, as Chin fans
                          like to say, a look of astonishment. The profuse mane around the neck and shoulders, the
                          plumed tail arching over the back, and the pants or culottes on the hind legs project the
                          elegant, exotic appearance so typical of Asia's royal line of laptop cuddle bugs.

                          The Japanese Spitz are little comedians who want to make you happy and laugh. They are very
                          loyal and smart and make wonderful companions. Game for adventures, they will tag along on a
                          hike, a car ride, or a trip to the beach or lake. They love their humans and just enjoy being
                          with them.
                          The Japanese Spitz, as a companion breed, enjoy the company of their families and truly are
                          little comedians. They love to please their family and are thus eager to learn; they always
                          have a smile on their face. Distinctive features include their pure white coat that has a
                          mane-like feature about their neck. Also, like other spitz breeds, their tails curl over their
                          back in a beautiful hair plume. A pointed muzzle likens them to a fox with a black nose, black
                          eye rims, and ears of pointed triangles, which stand erect and move like radar towers, hearing
                          everything going on around them and making this breed very alert.

                          Japanese Terriers are a small, highly intelligent breed full of terrier temperaments. They are
                          independent, active, crisp, and lively. As one-person dogs, they are often reserved with
                          strangers. Keen and alert, Japanese Terriers will hear the slightest noise and give warning to
                          any stranger. He has no issue with respectful children and other dogs. As a sporting terrier
                          and versatile, eager-to-learn dog, he has great athleticism and inborn instincts. By the
                          1900s, at the end of the Meiji Era, some of these best dogs were seen in the Kobe streets, and
                          were called the "Kobe Terriers". The appearance of these "Kobe Terriers" was like a mix of the
                          modern Smooth Fox Terriers and the Japanese Terriers. These dogs were the first terrier-type
                          dogs to be bred in Japan. The dogs had several names like "Oyuki Terriers" and "Mikado
                          Terriers", and were kept by the Japanese as well as some foreigners.
                          Around 1916, in the Nada ward near Kobe, a dog named Kuro meaning black in Japanese was born
                          from an out-cross breeding from English Toy Terriers and a Toy Bull Terrier both imported from
                          the Western countries. With careful selections of the breeding pairs out of these offsprings
                          and the Kobe Terriers a very short-haired, slim, small terrier type dog was born which are
                          today known as the Japanese Terriers. By 1930, their work with the breed helped develop a
                          standard and was finally recognized by the Japan Kennel Club. The Japanese Terriers did not
                          become widespread until 1940, when they were seen in most major Japanese cities. The demand
                          for this breed skyrocketed when these cities demanded for a small, more active dog than large
                          watch-dogs. However, the breed faced two instances throughout its history where they faced
                          extinction later on: first during World War II, and then around 1948 when the Western breeds
                          became more fashionable.

                          Loyal, watchful, and intelligent, the Jindo developed as a breed on an island off the coast of
                          South Korea. Medium-sized and natural in appearance, they are valued as independent hunters,
                          discerning guardians, and loyal companions.
                          The Jindo Dog is a well-proportioned, medium-sized dog used for hunting and guarding. With
                          erect ears and a rolled or sickle-shaped tail, it should be a vivid expression of agility,
                          strength, alertness and dignity.The Jindo has a very strong instinct for hunting and is bold,
                          brave, alert and careful, not tempted easily and impetuous. But most of all he is extremely
                          faithful to his master. On the whole he is not fond of other animals, especially males. He
                          also has a good sense of direction. A one-man dog, he readily accepts a new master, but never
                          forgets his attachment towards the former master who raised him from puppyhood. He keeps
                          himself clean and eats sparingly.

                          The Kai Ken is a medium-sized dog and is one of the six native Japanese breeds. Traditionally
                          used to hunt a wide range of game in the mountains of Japan, the Kai Ken is considered a rare
                          breed even in Japan. The Kai is highly intelligent and learns quickly. They seem to learn as
                          fast as the other Japanese breeds if not faster. They are not as independent and are more
                          willing to please their companions. The Japanese describe the Kai Ken as a trustworthy
                          guardian and extremely devoted to his master.
                          Kai Ken are athletic and intelligent with a strong desire to hunt. The Kai is an independent
                          thinker and can form a strong bond with their family. They are excellent swimmers and climbers
                          and have been known to climb trees and swim rivers in pursuit of game. Kai have a distinct
                          brindle coat that comes in three colors: Black Brindle (Kuro-Tora), Brindle (Chu-Tora), and
                          Red Brindle (Aka-Tora). Red brindle is the rarest of the coat colors. The distinct coloring
                          and brindle pattern enabled the dog to blend in to the mountainous forests in which it hunted,
                          camouflaging it against prey and predators in ancient times. The amount of brindle will vary
                          from dog to dog as well as the brindle pattern. Most puppies are born completely black and
                          their brindle will emerge as they age and will continue to change for around the first five
                          years of their life. In the home, the Kai Ken requires basic canine care. They can be kept in
                          an apartment setting provided they receive regular exercise in the form of leashed walks.
                          Being a naturally clean breed, bathing should be limited to only when dirty. Brushing is
                          recommended, especially during twice-a-year coat blowing.

                          The Karelian Bear Dog is an eager hunter and very independent, yet works cooperatively to mark
                          game by barking. Their senses, especially smell, are sharp, thus the breed is suitable for big
                          game hunting. They have a very good sense of direction, are balanced, courageous and
                          persistent. This breed has a highly developed spirit for game and are very self-confident.
                          They may be territorial towards other males, but are never aggressive towards people, though
                          they may be slightly reserved.
                          The Karelian Bear Dog is a medium-sized spitz with a dense coat, but his standards are closer
                          to that of non-spitz dogs such as the Samoyed and Siberian Husky, though the similarities end
                          there. Bred to hunt large, aggressive game by himself, his build reflects his duties. He is a
                          silent hunter, and only barks once the game is stopped or treed. Working with an experienced
                          hunter, he communicates the type of animal he has located by the sound of his bark. Though he
                          can demonstrate self-control around people, his fighting spirit surfaces around other dogs and
                          can be difficult to handle. His spirit easily turns into aggression, as Karelian Bear Dogs
                          love a challenge.

                          The amiable Keeshond is a medium-sized spitz dog of ample coat, famous for the distinctive
                          "spectacles" on his foxy face. Once a fixture on the canal barges of his native Holland, the
                          Kees was, and remains, a symbol of Dutch patriotism.
                          These square, sturdy companions descend from the same ancient stock as other spitz types, such
                          as Pomeranians and Samoyeds. Typically "spitzy," Keeshonden have a foxy face, pointed ears, an
                          abundant coat, and a plumed tail carried high over the back. A unique breed
                          characteristic and one of the most charming hallmarks in all dogdom is the spectacles.
                          These shadings and markings around the eyes give the impression that a Kees is wearing
                          designer eyewear. The specs draw attention to an alert, intelligent expression.

                          Among the largest of AKC terriers, the Kerry Blue Terrier is famous for his show-stopping blue
                          coat. Named for the Irish county of his birth, this onetime farm dog is today an alert,
                          adaptable, and animated watchdog and family companion. Of course, we begin with the
                          show-stopping coat that turns heads wherever Kerries go. It comes in shades of blue from a
                          deep slate to a light blue-gray and is so soft that it's as pleasing to the touch as it is to
                          the eye. The dense coat covers a muscular, well-developed body standing below 20 inches at the
                          shoulder and weighing up to 40 pounds. A sporty beard and dark, keen eyes accentuate the
                          nobility of the long terrier head.

                          and powerful guardian covered in profuse white cords. A big male can stand more than 27.5
                          inches and weigh over 100 pounds, with heavy bone, a deep chest, and lots of muscle. Despite
                          their brawn Komondorok are agile and light-footed, and move with long strides. With their
                          unique look, it's impossible to mistake Koms for anything else.

                          The Kromfohrlander is a medium-sized companion breed that is sensitive, loving and loyal to
                          its owners. He has a distinctive 'smile' and will sneeze to greet you. Pronunciation of the
                          breed is "krome-for-lahn-dair."
                          The Kromfohrlander is a very intelligent, funny, agile dog which loves to climb and jump and
                          easily excels at agility and dog-trick training but can be fussy with food. They come in two
                          coat types: wirehaired (with beard) and smooth haired (smooth face with no beard and
                          beautiful, long, soft hair). The breed's nickname in North America is "Kromi" (krome-ee). The
                          Kromfohrlander was bred to be a companion only, retains very little hunting instinct (despite
                          its terrier heritage), and is often long-lived (17-18 years old). He is good with children and
                          family and tends to be a one-person dog. He is very attached to his owner, will not run away,
                          and is first to alert to strangers.

                          The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are
                          friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go
                          around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador
                          Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh
                          between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious
                          chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter
                          tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are famously friendly.
                          They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with
                          neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy:
                          The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon
                          games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.

                          The Lagotto Romagnolo, Italy's adorable 'truffle dog,' sports a curly coat and lavish facial
                          furnishings. Despite their plush-toy looks, Lagotti are durable workers of excellent nose who
                          root out truffles, a dainty and pricey delicacy.
                          Italians have a word for it: 'carino.' In English, we say 'cute.' In any language, this breed
                          is totally endearing. The Lagotto Romagnolo (plural: Lagotti Romagnoli) is known for wooly
                          curls that cover the body head to tail, crowned by a lavish beard, eyebrows, and whiskers.
                          Lagotti stand under 20 inches and weigh no more than 35 pounds. But don't be fooled by their
                          teddy-bear looks, these are rugged workers of true strength and endurance. The breed's
                          trademark curls feel and behave more like human hair than fur.

                          A bold, zesty "big dog in a small package," the Lakeland Terrier, named for the Lake District
                          of his native England, was once a farmer's dog bred to work in packs on sheep-stealing foxes.
                          The Lakie's coat is hard, wiry, and low-shedding.
                          Square and sturdy Lakelands, standing less than 15 inches at the shoulder and weighing about
                          17 pounds, are small dogs. But don't tell them that. With their cock-of-the-walk swagger,
                          Lakelands personify the old dog-lover's cliché "a big dog in a small package." They come in
                          several colors; some have a sporty saddle mark on the back. With folded V-shaped ears, a
                          straight front, rectangular head, and a mischievous twinkle in their eye, Lakelands are the
                          blueprint of a long-legged British terrier.

                          The Lancashire Heeler is a medium to high energy dog. Intelligent, alert and friendly, they
                          are quick to learn new tasks. A sturdy little dog with a short, weather-resistant coat of
                          black and tan or liver and tan, they are affectionate with their owners, always happy,
                          talkative and always ready for a walk. Their small size is what gives them their charm.
                          Small, powerful, sturdily built, alert and an energetic worker, the Lancashire Heeler works
                          cattle but has terrier instincts when rabbiting and ratting. They have a unique characteristic
                          called the Heeler Smile; when content, Heelers have been known to draw back their lips in an
                          effort that emulates a human smile. In 2003, the breed was placed on the Endangered Breeds
                          list of The Kennel Club, U.K, due to the small number of dogs composing the gene pool and the
                          risk of several inherited diseases.

                          The Lapponian Herder is a medium-sized dog with a medium coat, making them easy to maintain
                          and perfect for any experienced dog owner. They are a wonderful, rounded, diversified dog
                          breed ready to problem solve any task given to them. They can fit into most living
                          environments as long as they are given jobs to do. This breed comes in many colors including
                          grey-brown, black often with lighter undercoats, and white or tan markings. They are aloof
                          with strangers but love their people.
                          The Lapponian Herder is an independent, fun breed. They are very intelligent and generally
                          eager to please. As a high-energy herding breed, they excel in many other dog sports besides
                          herding, such as companion events. Its love of hard work makes it a wonderful breed in any
                          event that is competitive and fun. Early socialization is important because of their herding
                          mentality and they thrive when they have a job to do. Though eager to please, the Lapponian
                          Herder is very vocal and often barks while working.

                          patience and they relish the companionship of the whole family. A huge and powerful dog, yes,
                          but the Leonberger is also known for his aristocratic grace and elegance. A male can stand
                          over 31 inches at the shoulder and weigh as much as a full-grown human. Females run smaller
                          but are still a whole lot of dog. Breed hallmarks include a medium-long waterproof coat, lush
                          triangular ears, a bushy tail, and a black facemask that frames kindly dark-brown eyes. A
                          dramatic feature of the male's coat is the lion-like mane around the neck and chest. A
                          well-built Leo moves with an easy, elastic gait. A Leo is friendly but nobody's fool. As
                          watchdogs and all-around workers, they exhibit intelligence and sound judgment. Leos require
                          lots of brushing, ample room for romping, and unlimited love.

                          The lavishly coated Lhasa Apso is a thousand-year-old breed who served as sentinels at palaces
                          and monasteries isolated high in the Himalayas. Smart, confident, and complex, Lhasas are
                          family comedians but regally aloof with strangers.
                          Standing less than a foot high at the shoulder, Lhasas are small but hardy dogs of
                          aristocratic bearing. They're famous for a floor-length, flat-hanging coat, parted in the
                          middle and draping each side of the body. A feathery tail curls over the back in the distinct
                          manner of Tibetan breeds. The breed's fans say the dark, oval-shaped eyes peeping through
                          lavish facial hair are the windows of a Lhasa's merry soul. The complete picture is
                          unmistakably Asian: exotic, elegant, and serenely well balanced.

                          A companion dog whose name is German for little lion, the Löwchen has been a popular pet among
                          Continental Europeans for more than 500 years. The portable, non-shedding Löwchen is said to
                          be affectionate, lively, and brave as a lion. Small dogs with enormous heart, LÃwchen (the
                          same singular or plural) stand a bit over a foot tall at the shoulder. The coat is
                          traditionally kept in a lion clip, in which most of the hindquarters and tail are clipped down
                          close to the skin. The overall effect is that of a mini lion, with a full mane and plumed
                          tail. The coat comes in several colors and color combinations. Beneath the coat is a dog
                          that's strong and sturdy, but elegant and artfully balanced.

                          The tiny Maltese, 'Ye Ancient Dogge of Malta,' has been sitting in the lap of luxury since the
                          Bible was a work in progress. Famous for their show-stopping, floor-length coat, Maltese are
                          playful, charming, and adaptable toy companions.
                          Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered by a long,
                          straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body moving with a smooth and
                          effortless gait. The overall picture depicts free-flowing elegance and balance. The
                          irresistible Maltese face' with its big, dark eyes and black gumdrop nose' can conquer the
                          most jaded sensibility. Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable
                          pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game
                          little athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make
                          new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based
                          training.

                          The Manchester Terrier is named after the English city where it was first bred. Sleek, racy
                          dogs who possess a terrier's ratting instinct and the graceful contours of coursing hounds,
                          Manchesters are spirited, bright, and athletic. They combine the streamlined grace of a
                          coursing hound and the instincts of a fearless rat terrier. These racy dogs come in two size
                          varieties: Standard (not exceeding 22 pounds) and Toy (not exceeding 12 pounds). All
                          Manchesters are similar in temperament, body type and athletic ability despite differences in
                          size. They're easily recognized by a tight coat of rich mahogany tan and jet black. The head
                          is long and wedge-shaped; tan spots above each eye point up a watchful expression. Manchesters
                          can motor, running with good reach in front and propulsive rear drive powered by a muscular
                          caboose.

                          The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type. It was first bred
                          in the 19th century to control vermin, notably rats, at which it excelled. So efficient at the
                          task was it that it often appeared in rat-baiting pits until that sport, which had effectively
                          been illegal in the UK since 1835, finally died out at the beginning of the 20th century.
                          The breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic
                          disorders. A crash in the number of registered Manchester Terriers following the Second World
                          War has resulted in the Kennel Club categorising it as a vulnerable native breed, in danger of
                          extinction.

                          A Mastiff is a large and powerful type of dog. Mastiffs are among the largest dogs, and
                          typically have a short coat, a long low-set tail and large feet; the skull is large and bulky,
                          the muzzle broad and short (brachycephalic) and the ears drooping and pendant-shaped. European
                          and Asian records dating back 3,000 years show dogs of the mastiff type. Mastiffs have
                          historically been guard dogs, protecting homes and property, although throughout history they
                          have been used as hunting dogs, war dogs and for blood sports, such as fighting each other and

                          The Miniature American Shepherd, frequently abbreviated MAS, is a small herding dog breed. The
                          MAS is highly intelligent and biddable. The breed is often trained for dog sports such as
                          herding, agility, obedience, canine freestyle, flyball, and others. The Miniature American
                          Shepherd was recognised by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2015 and is the club's 186th
                          breed. In September 2019, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) officially accepted
                          the breed.

                          In most every way the Miniature Bull Terrier is a Bull Terrier, only smaller. These upbeat,
                          mischievous dogs come equipped with terrier fire and fearlessness. If ever a dog could claim
                          the title 'Clown Prince of Dogdom,' it's the Mini.
                          Like the class clown or an adorable toddler, the Miniature Bull Terrier is full of mischief
                          and high spirits. With square bodies and egg-shaped heads, no other breed looks quite like it.
                          These small, muscular terriers are strong, active, fearless, and endlessly entertaining. As
                          fun as he is, it's not a good idea to let your Miniature Bull Terrier puppy get away with too
                          many high jinxes. He'll be at his absolute best with early socialization and patient training;
                          you couldn't ask for a more amusing companion.

                          The leggy Miniature Pinscher is known to fans as the King of Toys. This proud, fearless,
                          fun-loving toy breed of lustrous coat and a compact, wedge-shaped physique is a true
                          personality dog, known for a high-stepping hackney gait. Min Pins are sturdy, compact dogs
                          standing no more than 12.5 inches at the shoulder. The smooth, shiny coat comes in two shades
                          of solid red, or chocolate-and-rust or black-and-rust. The dark, slightly oval eyes and
                          high-set ears help bring out a self-possessed, big dog personality. A distinguishing
                          characteristic is the Min Pin's high-stepping hackney gait, reminiscent of a hackney horse at
                          the trot.

                          The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in
                          Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers may have been developed from the
                          smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer, or crosses between the standard and one or more
                          smaller breeds such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Pinscher, and Poodles, as farmers bred a
                          small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as "spunky" but aloof dogs,
                          with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature
                          Schnauzers are recognized in four colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, salt
                          and pepper, and white

                          The Mountain Cur is a hunting dog with a good treeing instinct. It is a very courageous
                          fighter and extremely intelligent, doing whatever job its master desires. The dogs were a
                          crucial part of the cultures of early pioneers, settlers, and homesteaders.
                          The Mountain Cur is a fast, hard hunter that runs track with its head in the air. He can be
                          open, semi-open, or silent on track and has a clear bark that can be heard a long distance.
                          They will circle and drift on a cold track if a hot one is not available until they locate a
                          hot track. They are courageous fighters when required and extremely intelligent, with strong
                          treeing instincts, and can easily be trained to leave unwanted game. They respond best to
                          training with a lot of human contact, and in addition to hunting, make great companions and
                          watch dogs.

                          The Mudi is a herding dog breed from Hungary. It is closely related to the Puli and Pumi, from
                          which it was separated in the 1930s. They continue to be used in herding, as well as
                          participating in a variety of dog sports. Mudis are a high energy breed, and tend succeed in
                          herding and agility. Mudis have a lifespan of 12-14 years with proper care. Adult Mudis are
                          14-18 inches in height and usually weigh around 18-29 lbs. The Mudi is a very active breed.
                          They need to be taken on daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from
                          a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to
                          be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as
                          Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund,
                          showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be
                          measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be
                          trained to compete in herding trials.

                          The Neapolitan Mastiff or Mastino Napoletano is an Italian breed of large dog of mastiff type.
                          It descends from the traditional guard dogs of central Italy. It was recognised as a breed
                          by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana in 1949, and accepted by the Fédération
                          Cynologique Internationale in 1956.
                          It is closely related to the Cane Corso.
                          The skin is abundant and loose, particularly on the head where it hangs in heavy wrinkles. The
                          preferred coat colours are black, grey and leaden, but mahogany, fawn, fulvous, hazelnut,
                          dove-grey and isabelline are also acceptable; all coats may be brindled, and minor white
                          markings on the toes and chest are tolerated.

                          Kooikerhondjes are cheerful, good natured, friendly, quiet, well-behaved, and alert. Depending
                          on its domestic environment, it is kind, happy and lively, but likely due to breeding, can be
                          reactive to other dogs. They are also intelligent, attentive and more than willing to please
                          their owner. The Kooikerhondje adapts to situations rather quickly, changing his behavior from
                          quiet to lively when the situation allows them to be. They will not always immediately like
                          strangers, instead choosing to retreat. But once they warm up to someone, the trust will be
                          there for the rest of their life. The Kooikerhondje can make a fine apartment dog if exercised
                          regularly, but a fenced yard will be more ideal. They have a medium energy level, yet are
                          usually quiet when indoors. Kooikerhondje can be reactive with strange dogs and are wary of
                          boisterous children, in general. Overall, Kooikerhondjes are great companions.

                          The Newfoundland is a large working dog. They can be black, brown, grey, or white. However, in
                          the Dominion of Newfoundland, before it became part of the confederation of Canada, only black
                          and Landseer (white-and-black) coloured dogs were considered to be proper members of the
                          breed. They were originally bred and used as working dogs for fishermen in
                          Newfoundland.Newfoundlands are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength,
                          calm disposition, love of children and loyalty. They excel at water rescue/lifesaving because
                          of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed paws, and swimming abilities.

                          Norfolk Terriers are little, cute, and loyal, and they will gladly curl up in your lap, but
                          don't dare call them lapdogs. Norfolks, despite their toyish qualities, are genuine
                          terriers'¿feisty, confident, sturdy, and game for adventure. Norfolk Terriers are among the
                          smallest working terriers, standing no higher than 10 inches at the shoulder. The coat is
                          hard, wiry, and straight. They share many traits with their close cousins, Norwich Terriers.
                          To tell them apart, look at the ears: The Norwich has erect, pointed ears; Norfolk ears are
                          neatly folded over. Bred to work in packs, Norfolks are more gregarious than a typical
                          terrier, but they have plenty of the old terrier pep. Few Norfolks these days earn their
                          living hunting rodents, but a good one will fearlessly do so when given a chance. Norfolks
                          bond closely, sometimes jealously, with their owners and make nice watchdogs. They have a
                          reputation as a good traveler: portable, adaptable, and up for anything.

                          extremely agile. They are calm, keen, and attentive, with a kind disposition.
                          Nobs aren't large dogs (a big male stands a shade below 20 inches) but their tough, sinewy
                          bodies are built to withstand punishing terrain and harsh climates. They are a small-sized
                          hunting dog of Spitz-type, which was thought to be extinct but survived as a farm and hunting
                          dog in the Northern parts of Sweden and Finland. To be able to navigate the rough terrain and
                          climate of the Scandinavian forests and hold large dangerous game, like moose, Norrbottenspets
                          evolved to be extremely agile, rugged, and weatherproof with a fearless attitude, while at the
                          same time kind and affectionate companions at home. They exhibit no extremes in physical

                          good opportunity to explain the term. Spitz are cold-weather breeds characterized by a dense
                          coat, a tail curved tightly over the back, a wedge-shaped head, and erect, pointed ears (spitz
                          means pointed in ancient German). They can be pint-sized like Pomeranians, mighty like
                          Malamutes, or mid-sized like the lithe but sturdy Buhund. Males can stand 18.5 inches high and
                          weight up to 40 pounds. Coat colors are wheaten or black.

                          dignified but friendly demeanor. The durable Elkhound is among Europe's oldest dogs. They
                          sailed with the Vikings and figure in Norse art and legend. Norwegian Elkhounds are hardy,
                          short-bodied dogs standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. They have a dense silver-gray coat
                          and a tail curling tightly over the back. The deep chest, sturdy legs, and muscular thighs
                          belong to a dog built for an honest day's work. The eyes are a dark brown and the ears mobile
                          and erect. Overall, an Elkhound is the picture of an alert and steadfast dog of the north.
                          Elkhounds are famously fine companions and intelligent watchdogs. Agility and herding trials
                          are good outlets for their natural athleticism and eagerness. Reserved until introductions are
                          made, an Elkhound is a trustworthy friend ever after. These strong, confident dogs are truly
                          sensitive souls, with a dash of houndy independence.

                          From Norway's rocky island of Vaeroy, the uniquely constructed Norwegian Lundehund is the only
                          dog breed created for the job of puffin hunting. With puffins now a protected species, today's
                          Lundehund is a friendly, athletic companion.
                          At a glance, Lundehunds seem a typical northern breed: A spitz type with triangular ears,
                          curving tail, and a dense double coat. But a closer look reveals several unique traits. They
                          have feet with at least six fully functioning toes and extra paw pads, an 'elastic neck' that
                          can crane back so the head touches the spine, ears that fold shut, and flexible shoulders that
                          allow forelegs to extend to the side, perpendicular to the body. This last anomaly produces
                          the breed's distinctive 'rotary' gait.

                          Norwich Terriers are plucky little earthdogs named for their hometown in England. The old
                          cliche "a big dog in a small package" was coined for breeds like the Norwich, who can be
                          oblivious to the fact that they are just 10 inches tall.
                          Standing no more than 10 inches at the shoulder and weighing about 12 pounds, Norwich are
                          among the smallest working terriers. Beneath the hard, wiry coat is a stocky, substantial dog.
                          Norwiches are toy-sized but are not satin-pillow dogs' they were originally bred as tough and
                          fearless ratters. They are distinguished from their doggy doppelganger, the Norfolk Terrier,
                          by their erect, pointed ears. Happy-go-lucky, fearless, and sometimes even bossy, Norwiches
                          are energetic enough to play fetch all day, but affectionate enough to enjoy hours of lap time
                          with their favorite human. Short, positive training sessions work best with this clever but
                          sometimes stubborn breed. Three words convey the overall dog: cute, cuter, and cutest.

                          The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a medium-sized gundog bred primarily for hunting. It
                          is often referred to as a "toller". It is the smallest of the retrievers, and is often
                          mistaken for a small Golden Retriever. Tollers are intelligent, eager to please, alert, and
                          energetic. The name "toller" is derived from their ability to lure waterfowl within gunshot
                          range. The breed originated in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The American Kennel Club
                          ranks the toller as the 87th most popular dog breed.

                          The Old English Sheepdog is a large dog, immediately recognizable by its long, thick, shaggy grey and white coat, with fur covering their face and eyes. The ears lie flat to the head. Historically, the breed's tail was commonly docked (resulting in a panda bear-like rear end), but tailed Old English sheepdogs are now common, as many countries have outlawed cosmetic docking. When the dog has a tail, it has long fur (feathering), is low set, and normally hangs down. The Old English Sheepdog stands lower at the shoulder than at the loin, and walks with a "bear-like roll from the rear".

                          Big, boisterous, and affectionate, the Otterhound was bred in medieval England for the now-outlawed activity of otter hunting. This scarce breed is known for his dense shaggy coat, webbed feet, acute sense of smell, and affinity for swimming. These big, bouncy hounds were ideally suited for otter hunting. OHs are built to be expert swimmers, from the top of their rough, waterproof coat to the bottom of their big webbed feet. A broad chest and powerful shoulders allow them to swim all day without tiring. Their large black nose is amazingly sensitive and could follow an otter's underwater scent trail over great distances. And the OH's size and strength enabled them to take on a sharp-toothed, razor-clawed otter that might weigh 20 pounds.
