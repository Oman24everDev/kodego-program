                              Loyal, curious, and famously amusing, this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all
                              proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it's the Affenpinscher's apparent
                              seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.
                              The Affen's apish look has been described many ways. They've been called 'monkey dogs' and
                              'ape terriers.' The French say diablotin moustachu ('mustached little devil'), and Star
                              Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks. Standing less than a foot
                              tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. 'This isn't a
                              breed you train, 'a professional dog handler tells us, 'He's like a human. You befriend
                              him.'¬ù The dense, harsh coat is described as 'neat but shaggy' and comes in several
                              colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly
                              Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being
                              owned by their little monkey dogs.

                              Among the most eye-catching of all dog breeds, the Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified
                              aristocrat of sublime beauty. Despite his regal appearance, the Afghan can exhibit an
                              endearing streak of silliness and a profound loyalty.
                              Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the
                              thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed's crowning glory isn't just for show ' it
                              served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans
                              originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan's glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile
                              hound ' standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder ' built for a long day's hunt. Their
                              huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland's punishing terrain. The Afghan
                              Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, 'It's not the breed
                              for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal
                              can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.

                              His size, strength, and unflagging spirit have earned the Airedale Terrier the nickname
                              'The King of Terriers.'¬ù The Airedale stands among the world's most versatile dog breeds
                              and has distinguished himself as hunter, athlete, and companion.
                              The Airedale Terrier is the largest of all terrier breeds. Males stand about 23 inches at
                              the shoulder, females a little less. The dense, wiry coat is tan with black markings.
                              Long, muscular legs give Airedales a regal lift in their bearing, and the long head'¬øwith
                              its sporty beard and mustache, dark eyes, and neatly folded ears'¬øconveys a keen
                              intelligence. Airedales are the very picture of an alert and willing terrier'¬øonly bigger.
                              And, like his smaller cousins in the terrier family, he can be bold, determined, and
                              stubborn. Airedales are docile and patient with kids but won't back down when protecting
                              hearth and home. Thanks to their famous do-it-all attitude, Airedales excel in all kinds
                              of sports and family activities.

                              The Akita is a muscular, double-coated dog of ancient Japanese lineage famous for their
                              dignity, courage, and loyalty. In their native land, they're venerated as family
                              protectors and symbols of good health, happiness, and long life.
                              Akitas are burly, heavy-boned spitz-type dogs of imposing stature. Standing 24 to 28
                              inches at the shoulder, Akitas have a dense coat that comes in several colors, including
                              white. The head is broad and massive, and is balanced in the rear by a full, curled-over
                              tail. The erect ears and dark, shining eyes contribute to an expression of alertness, a
                              hallmark of the breed. Akitas are quiet, fastidious dogs. Wary of strangers and often
                              intolerant of other animals, Akitas will gladly share their silly, affectionate side with
                              family and friends. They thrive on human companionship. The large, independent-thinking
                              Akita is hardwired for protecting those they love. They must be well socialized from birth
                              with people and other dogs.

                              The Alaskan Klee Kai is a small-sized companion dog that is alert, energetic, and curious,
                              yet reserved with unfamiliar people and situations.
                              The Alaskan Klee Kai is a small sized companion dog with a smooth, agile, and
                              well-balanced gait, a body that is well proportioned with a level topline and a length
                              slightly longer than height. The wedge-shaped head, erect triangle shaped ears, well
                              furred double coat in three symmetrical contrasting color varieties, and a loosely curled
                              tail reflect its arctic heritage.

                              An immensely strong, heavy-duty worker of spitz type, the Alaskan Malamute is an
                              affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified dog recognizable by his well-furred plumed
                              tail carried over the back, erect ears, and substantial bone. The Alaskan Malamute stands
                              23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests
                              their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and
                              dense, weatherproof coat all scream, 'I work hard for a living!'¬ù But their almond-shaped
                              brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans
                              when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family 'pack,'¬ù the leader
                              must be you. If a Mal doesn't respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other
                              way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a
                              well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with'¬øplayful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids.

                              American Bulldogs are a well-balanced athletic dog that demonstrate great strength,
                              endurance, agility, and a friendly attitude. Historically, they were bred to be a utility
                              dog used for working the farm.
                              The American Bulldog is a descendant of the English Bulldog. It is believed that the
                              bulldog was in America as early as the 17th century. They came to the United States in the
                              1800s, with immigrants who brought their working bulldogs with them. Small farmers and
                              ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock
                              dogs, and catch dogs. The breed largely survived, particularly in the southern states, due
                              to its ability to bring down and catch feral pigs.
                              The breed we know as the American Bulldog was originally known by many different names
                              before the name American Bulldog became the standard. In different parts of the South he
                              was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just "bulldog." The
                              breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real
                              bulldog work.

                              These sleek and racy, lean but muscular hounds work dusk to dawn in pursuit of the wily
                              raccoon. The sight of the American English Coonhound tearing through the moonlit woods,
                              all sinew and determination, bawling their lusty night music, is coon-hunter heaven.
                              Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, American English Coonhounds are
                              deep-chested, sweet-faced athletes beloved by sportsmen for their speed and endurance.
                              Stretched tightly across the athletic frame is a medium-length coat of various patterns,
                              some with ticking. The head is broad with a domed skull, with soft, low-hung ears and
                              dark-brown eyes that glow with warmth and kindness. American English Coonhounds are mellow
                              when off duty but tenacious and stubborn in pursuit of their ring-tailed prey. Their work
                              drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting,
                              and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners.
                              Some passionate fans of American English Coonhounds feel that without a sporting outlet
                              for this breed's houndy virtues, you're simply wasting a good dog.

                              The American Eskimo Dog combines striking good looks with a quick and clever mind in a
                              total brains-and-beauty package. Neither shy nor aggressive, Eskies are always alert and
                              friendly, though a bit conservative when making new friends. The American Eskimo Dog comes
                              in three sizes'¬østandard, miniature, and toy'¬østanding as tall as 19 inches at the
                              shoulder or as short as 9 inches. Distinctive traits include a dense, sparkling white coat
                              with a lion-like ruff around the chest and shoulders; a smiling face, with black nose,
                              lips, and eye-rims that convey a keen, intelligent expression; and a plumed tail carried
                              over the back. Some Eskies have markings with the delicious color name 'biscuit cream.'¬ù
                              They move with a bold and agile gait. Eskies are social animals and can develop problem
                              behaviors when neglected or undertrained' they insist on being part of family life. Among
                              the most trainable of breeds, the clever, kid-friendly Eskie practically invented the
                              phrase 'eager to please.'

                              American Foxhounds are good-natured, low-maintenance hounds who get on well with kids,
                              dogs, even cats, but come with special considerations for prospective owners. They are
                              closely associated with Revolutionary heroes and the rolling estates of old Virginia.
                              American Foxhounds are sleek, rangy hunters known for their speed, endurance, and work
                              ethic. You can tell the American Foxhound apart from their British cousin the English
                              Foxhound by length of leg'¬øthe American's legs are longer and more finely boned'¬øand by
                              the American's slightly arched loin (back end). American Foxhounds have large, soft eyes
                              with an expression described as gentle and pleading. So far, so good. But Foxhounds come
                              with special considerations. They need lots of exercise or they can get depressed and
                              destructive. A Foxhound's single-minded prey drive must be managed. Their loud bawling is
                              melodious to hound lovers but can be a nuisance to neighbors, and training and
                              housebreaking these independent souls can be a steep challenge for novice owners.

                              The American Hairless Terrier, a Louisiana native, is a smart, inquisitive, and playful
                              dog that comes in hairless and coated varieties. He is a fine choice for allergy sufferers
                              who want a dog with true terrier grit and courage.
                              The American Hairless Terrier stands between 12 to 16 inches at the shoulder, and comes in
                              both coated and hairless varieties. The hairless variety might have eyebrows and whiskers,
                              while the coated has a short, shiny coat. The skin of the hairless is smooth and warm to
                              the touch. The broad, wedge-shaped head is a hallmark of both varieties. Erect, V-shaped
                              ears frame the round, expressive eyes that gleam with curiosity.
                              The American Hairless moves with jaunty pep in his step that announces real terrier
                              attitude. The hairless variety is as hypoallergenic as a dog can get. Hairlessness,
                              though, presents its own challenges. Sunburn is a concern, and cold weather requires
                              special precautions. This breed is protective of their humans and make alert watchdogs.

                              Intelligence is one of the American Leopard Hound's very best attributes. The breed is
                              loving and affectionate toward their family and they are extremely protective of children.
                              American Leopards are one of the oldest tree dog breeds in the U.S. and have extremely
                              strong tracking abilities, often able to track prey for miles.
                              The American Leopard Hound is a medium to large size dog and comes in three patterns:
                              Solid, Leopard and Brindle; nine different official colors; and a variety of markings,
                              however, sixty percent of all American Leopards are solid-colored dogs. The breed is very
                              versatile in hunting a variety of game species including, but not limited to, raccoon,
                              bear, bobcat, cougar, squirrel, and any other tree-minded game. As an especially tough
                              breed, they also fare exceptionally well in extreme weather, both hot and cold.

                              The American Staffordshire Terrier, known to their fans as AmStaffs, are smart, confident,
                              good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized
                              AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end. AmStaffs are stocky, muscular bull-type
                              terriers standing 17 to 19 inches at the shoulder. The head is broad, the jaws well
                              defined, the cheekbones pronounced, and the dark, round eyes are set wide apart. AmStaff
                              movement is agile and graceful, with a springy gait that advertises the breed's innate
                              confidence. The stiff, glossy coat comes in many colors and patterns. AmStaffers describe
                              their dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and lovable
                              'personality dogs'¬ù around the house. AmStaffs like mental and physical challenges. They
                              are highly trainable, as their many forays into showbiz suggest. When acquiring an
                              AmStaff, there's only one way to go: Do your homework and find a responsible AKC breeder.

                              The American Water Spaniel, native to the lake country of the upper Midwest, is an upbeat,
                              outdoorsy athlete who loves to hunt and swim. They are known to be happy, eager, and
                              charming, though aloof with strangers and a bit stubborn. American Water Spaniels are
                              muscular midsize gundogs, not flashy in looks or performance, and recognizable by a
                              luscious brown coat that is either tightly curled or wavy. Bred to work the icy waters and
                              marshy banks of the Great Lakes region, these spaniels are ideally outfitted for the job:
                              The coat is dense and waterproof, the feet are thickly padded, the toes are webbed, and
                              the body is small enough for the dog to hop in and out of a skiff without rocking the
                              boat. The breed's admirers describe a merry, intelligent, and versatile spaniel suited to
                              a variety of dog sports. As hunters, they combine the working traits of spaniels and
                              retrievers. The key to the American Water Spaniel's happiness is activity, especially
                              alongside their adored human. An underemployed dog can be barky and destructive.

                              An Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a rugged, imposing flock guardian of ancient lineage.
                              Protective and territorial, but also intelligent, patient, and profoundly loyal, these
                              muscular avengers are prized as working guard dogs without equal. The Anatolian Shepherd
                              Dog stands between 27 and 29 inches at the shoulder and can weigh as much as 150 pounds.
                              Profusely muscled but nimble afoot, Anatolians are more than a match for the predators and
                              harsh terrain of their homeland. Anatolians descend from some of the oldest known
                              domestic-canine bloodlines. This lends the breed a sense of timelessness, a no-frills,
                              untouched quality that takes us back 6,000 years to the Bronze Age. Anatolians are smart,
                              devoted, responsive, and adaptable. They will protect their flock'¬ølivestock, children,
                              smaller dogs, even the family cat'¬øwith intensity. Anatolian owners must be strong
                              leaders, willing and able to handle a dog as dominating and demanding as he is calm and
                              loving.

                              The Appenzeller Sennenhund is a medium sized herdng breed that is tri-color and almost
                              squarely built and balanced. He is muscular and agile and makes a good driving, watch,
                              guard, house or farm dog. Due to their versatility and willingness, they excel in agility,
                              obedience, herding and search and rescue.
                              The Appenzeller Sennenhund is one of the four Swiss Sennen type breeds and is also known
                              as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog or Appenzell Cattle Dog. He is lively, high-spirited,
                              self-assured, reliable and fearless. Slightly suspicious of strangers, he is a good
                              watchdog who cannot be bribed. The breed's intelligence make them highly capable learners.
                              Due to his personality and exercise needs, he is ill-suited to apartment living.

                              The compact but muscular Australian Cattle Dog, also called Blue Heeler or Queensland
                              Heeler, is related to Australia's famous wild dog, the Dingo. These resilient herders are
                              intelligent enough to routinely outsmart their owners. Standing between 17 to 20 inches at
                              the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and
                              agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns blue-gray or red. Both coat
                              varieties feature distinctive mottling or specking patterns. ACDs have immense work drive
                              and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy
                              and supple gait make them excellent running partners. ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously
                              smart, ever alert, and wary of strangers. If an ACD isn't challenged, he easily becomes
                              bored and gets into mischief. It is recommended that ACD owners participate with their dog
                              in some work, sport, or regular exercise to keep him mentally and physically fit.

                              As a herding dog, the Australian Kelpie is intensely loyal and devoted to duty. He has a
                              natural instinct and aptitude for working in sheep, whether it be in open fields or
                              enclosed yards. This breed originated from Collie type dogs imported from Scotland, but
                              was developed to withstand the harsh heat and dry conditions of the vast open spaces of
                              Australia.

                              The Australian Shepherd, a lean, tough ranch dog, is one of those 'only in America'¬ù
                              stories: a European breed perfected in California by way of Australia. Fixtures on the
                              rodeo circuit, they are closely associated with the cowboy life. The Australian Shepherd,
                              the cowboy's herding dog of choice, is a medium-sized worker with a keen, penetrating gaze
                              in the eye. Aussie coats offer different looks, including merle (a mottled pattern with
                              contrasting shades of blue or red). In all ways, they're the picture of rugged and agile
                              movers of stock. Aussies exhibit an irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs,
                              kids. This strong work drive can make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner.
                              Aussies are remarkably intelligent, quite capable of hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice
                              owner. In short, this isn't the pet for everyone. But if you're looking for a brainy,
                              tireless, and trainable partner for work or sport, your search might end here.

                              The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is not an Australian Cattle Dog with a docked tail.
                              They are naturally bob-tailed breed and stands square with plenty of leg length under the
                              body.
                              There are major structural differences in breed type between the two breeds of Cattle
                              Dogs. Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs are a natural bob-tail breed. Some Stumpy Tail pups are born
                              with long tails and should not be discarded from a breeding program if they are of
                              structural quality, and bred back to quality natural bob tails.

                              The diminutive Australian Terrier is plucky, spirited, and smart'¬øhow did they fit so much
                              dog into such a bitty package? Upbeat and lively, the self-assured Aussie approaches life
                              with plenty of the old-time terrier curiosity and grit. Australian Terriers are small but
                              sturdy, self-confident terriers known for a longish torso, distinctive coat furnishings
                              around the neck and forequarters, and a topknot of soft, silky hair that contrasts in
                              texture with an otherwise harsh coat. A long neck lends a dash of elegance to this
                              rough-and-ready terrier, and the dark eyes sparkle with a keen intelligence. Coat colors
                              are blue-and-tan, or solid red or sandy. Aussies move with the free and easy gait of a
                              working dog. They are alert watchdogs and said to be quick studies when training. True
                              terriers, Aussies love digging, and the urge to chase small, furry critters has never left
                              them. Not always a great fit in multi-dog households, Aussies want you all to themselves.

                              Tall and elegant, the Azawakh is a West African sighthound who originates from the
                              countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may
                              come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color
                              (which may be predominantly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask
                              and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no
                              color or marking disqualifications in the breed. Befitting its heritage, the Azawakh
                              excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States.
                              This ancient hunting hound is so lean and rangy that his bone structure and musculature
                              can plainly be seen beneath his skin. The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and
                              aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters
                              that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine
                              coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of
                              elegance and fineness, but don't be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who's been
                              chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years.

                              An archetypic water dog of France, the Barbet is a rustic breed of medium size and
                              balanced proportions who appears in artwork as early as the 16th century. In profile, the
                              Barbet is slightly rectangular with a substantial head and long, sweeping tail. He has a
                              long, dense covering of curly hair and a distinctive beard. An agile athlete, the Barbet
                              has been used primarily to locate, flush, and retrieve birds. He has a cheerful
                              disposition and is very social and loyal. The defining characteristic of this rustic,
                              medium-sized bird dog is the dense curly coat that covers him from the top of his large,
                              broad head to the tip of his curving tail. The coat comes in shades of black, gray, brown,
                              or fawn, sometimes with white markings. The breed's delightfully shaggy coat and amiable
                              nature creates the impression of a Muppet come to life, but the Barbet is a strong,
                              solidly-built dog bred for centuries to be a keen hunter and tireless swimmer. Barbets are
                              very intelligent and learn new things quickly. They have a calm nature and are easy to
                              live with as long as their exercise needs are being met.

                              that convey a variety of subtle, humanlike emotions. Basenjis are a lovely sight at a
                              standstill but more impressive yet at a fast trot, when they exhibit the long, smooth
                              strides of a mini-racehorse. And yes, it's true, they don't bark, but they make their
                              feelings known with an odd sound described as something between a chortle and a yodel.
                              Basenjis are fastidious and will groom themselves like cats. This has been called a 'cult
                              breed'small in numbers, but those lucky enough to own one do so with singular devotion.

                              Smart, courageous and determined, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a serious hunter, easily
                              adaptable to different types of game and terrain. It is equally an excellent companion
                              dog, being cheerful, intelligent and eager to please.
                              The Basset Fauve de Bretagne, also known as the Fawn Colored Brittany Basset, is a small,
                              stocky, rough-coated hardy dog that is energetic and fast for its size. The Fauve gets
                              along well with children and other pets. Training and socialization is a must or Fauves
                              can get into mischief. Not nuisance barkers, you will, however, know if a rabbit runs
                              through the yard, as they then give the hound 'voice' and chase. This breed is as happy
                              romping in the field as he is curled up next to the family on the sofa.

                              Among the most appealing of the AKC breeds, the endearing and instantly recognizable
                              Basset Hound is a perennial favorite of dog lovers all over the world. This low-slung and
                              low-key hound can be sometimes stubborn, but is always charming. The Basset Hound stands
                              no higher than 14 inches at the shoulder but, with his remarkably heavy bone, powerful
                              little legs, and massive paws, he possesses big-dog strength and stamina. Bassets are
                              famous for a large, domed head that features extremely long, velvety ears, mournful eyes,
                              and a wrinkled brow, which give the breed the look of a sad clown. Built more for
                              endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner. The breed's
                              scenting ability is uncanny; it's said that among dogs only the Bloodhound's nose is more
                              accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a
                              loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections,
                              they are steadfastly loyal.

                              The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is calm and balanced, devoted to its owner, and reserved
                              with strangers. He is a sound, self-assured, unafraid, biddable dog, neither shy nor
                              aggressive.
                              Hailing from Germany, the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is the Bayerischer
                              Gebirgsschweisshund in its native German. The breed's most notable trait is its
                              outstanding "cold nose" tracking ability. His nose is so acute, he can distinguish between
                              the injured game he is hunting and other animals of the same species. This somewhat
                              lightweight, active, medium-sized breed is devoted to his owner, but can be reserved with
                              strangers. He is not a kennel dog and prefers to be around his human family.

                              Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also
                              happy-go-lucky, funny, and thanks to its pleading expression cute. They were bred to hunt
                              in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing. There are two Beagle
                              varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15
                              inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches, as dog folks say.
                              They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's
                              fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy
                              ears set low on a broad head. A breed described as merry by its fanciers, Beagles are
                              loving and lovable, happy, and companionable all qualities that make them excellent family
                              dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among
                              American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of
                              playtime.

                              A boisterous and charismatic droving dog from Scotland, the shaggy-coated Bearded Collie
                              (Beardie to his friends) enjoys outdoor exercise in all weather. Bred to be independent
                              decision-makers, they can be willful but are always friendly. Standing 20 to 22 inches at
                              the shoulder and covered head to tail in a shaggy double coat, Beardies bear a passing
                              resemblance to another British favorite, the Old English Sheepdog. Beneath the coats,
                              Beardies are the more lean and angular of the two. The lavish facial hair shouldn't
                              obscure the characteristic expression: a dreamy, faraway gaze. These rambunctious comics
                              can be a handful'¬øbut mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and
                              laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They
                              bore easily, and training must be kept interesting. Outdoorsy families looking for a
                              sturdy dog to share an uptempo lifestyle will never find a more affectionate and amusing

                              The Beauceron is imposing and powerful, but also remarkably smart, spirited, and a
                              versatile herder. Imagine a Border Collie's brain in a 100-pound body. They are especially
                              beloved by women as a dashing but sensitive companion and protector.
                              Beaucerons are muscular, rugged, and large, standing as high as 27.5 inches at the
                              shoulder, and yet graceful and in all ways balanced. Their dark black coats feature
                              handsome squirrel-red accents, including the red feet that give the breed its French
                              nickname Bas-Rouge ('red stockings'). They're also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long
                              head is well chiseled, and the dark brown eyes project expression breed fanciers describe
                              as frank and confident. They're not for novice owners, who might end up being owned by
                              their dominant dog instead of the other way around. That said, well-trained and socialized
                              Beaucerons are levelheaded watchdogs and guardians, especially good with the young, the
                              small, and the defenseless.

                              Graceful terriers in sheep's clothing, Bedlington Terriers, named for the English mining
                              shire where they were first bred, are genial housemates, alert watchdogs, versatile
                              athletes, and irresistibly cuddly TV-time companions.
                              Bedlingtons are lithe, energetic Englishmen. The crisp, curly coat; arched back; tasseled
                              ears; scimitar-shaped tail; and fleecy, pear-shaped head are identifying features of this
                              one-of-a-kind breed. As the curvy contours indicate, there's sighthound¬øWhippet, most
                              likely¬øin their family tree. Bedlingtons move with a light, springy step and when roused
                              to pursuit can run like the wind. Rollicking, charming, and full of fun, Bedlingtons want
                              most to be their family's center of attention and are known to be protective of loved
                              ones. For an active family looking for a no-shedding, lively, and loyal companion, the
                              search might end here.

                              Strong, agile and full of life, the Belgian Laekenois (pronounced "Lak-in-wah") is one of
                              four native dogs of Belgium. Although similar in body and temperament to the Malinois,
                              Shepherd and Tervuren, the Laekenois differs in coat color, texture and length, as well as
                              region of origin.
                              Of the four closely related Belgian herders, the Belgian Sheepdog, Malinois, Tervuren, and
                              Laekenois, the Laekenois is the rarest. This strong and sturdy dog is distinguished from
                              his brethren by a rough, tousled coat that comes in shades of red or fawn or in grayish
                              tones. The blackening around the muzzle points up the expression of keen watchfulness
                              shining from the dark almond-shaped eyes. The Belgian Laekenois is protective of his
                              master and property. Although observant with strangers, the breed is affectionate and
                              friendly with those he knows well. The Laekenois coat requires regular brushing and
                              occasional bathing, and as a working dog, it needs daily exercise.

                              The smart, confident, and versatile Belgian Malinois is a world-class worker who forges an
                              unbreakable bond with his human partner. To deny a Mal activity and the pleasure of your
                              company is to deprive him of his very reasons for being. Belgian Malinois are squarely
                              built, proud, and alert herders standing 22 to 26 inches. Strong and well-muscled, but
                              more elegant than bulky, there's an honest, no-frills look about them, as befit dogs built
                              to work hard for their feed. A breed hallmark is the proud carriage of the head. Coat
                              colors range from a rich fawn to mahogany. The black ears and mask accentuate bright,
                              questioning eyes the color of dark Belgian chocolate. If you have ever seen a Mal perform
                              an obedience routine, you know firsthand what a smart and eager breed this is. Problems
                              set in, though, when this people-oriented dog is underemployed and neglected. Exercise,
                              and plenty of it, preferably side by side with their adored owner, is key to Mal
                              happiness.

                              The Belgian Sheepdog is a highly trainable herder whose versatility and intelligence is
                              the stuff of canine legend. This is a breed built for hard work, and plenty of it. These
                              sensitive souls crave human companionship and abhor neglect. The stirring silhouette of a
                              Belgian Sheepdog conveys both elegance and muscular determination. A handsome feature of
                              the breed is the exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck. A male might stand 26
                              inches at the shoulder; females are smaller. The dark eyes sparkle with a questioning
                              intelligence, and the black coat is abundant, from the neck's collarette to the breeches
                              of the hindquarters. In all ways, Belgian Sheepdogs are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. In
                              any sport or activity, a Belgian will always give 100 percent. In turn, owners tend to
                              form a special bond with their eager workaholics. As one devotee puts it, Belgians inspire
                              such intense loyalty because they themselves live and love with such great passion.

                              The elegant, agile Belgian Tervuren is a bright and self-assured herding dog of medium
                              size, known to be affectionate and possessive with loved ones. Lots of hard work and
                              challenging play is heaven for this tireless, do-it-all dog. The Belgian Tervuren is
                              characterized by a straight and abundant coat, an elegant but muscular frame, a proudly
                              carried head, an alert and intelligent demeanor, and an insatiable work drive. The Terv's
                              coat furnishings, like the sporty collarette around the neck, are more profuse on males,
                              who run larger than females. 'Their intelligence and high activity level can be a
                              challenge for the less creative individual who may not understand the breed's need to
                              work,'¬ù warns one longtime owner. But don't get the idea that Tervs are grim, mechanical
                              worker drones. In fact, Tervs take real delight in their ability to master any task, and
                              owners say a mischievous sense of humor is at work whenever Tervs outsmart their beloved
                              human.

                              Generally happy with kids and other animals, the low-maintenance and robustly healthy
                              Bergamasco is much more than a show-stopping hairdo. Eager to please, smart, and
                              stubbornly devoted to work, Bergamascos are patient but protective.
                              Beneath the one-of-a-kind coat is a large, muscular shepherd dog of ancient pedigree. But,
                              since the coat is the breed's hallmark, let's take a close look. The Bergamasco Sheepdog
                              has hair of three different textures that form naturally occurring loose mats, or 'flocks'
                              (strands of hair woven together, creating flat layers of felted hair), covering the body
                              and legs. The flocks provide protection from the fierce cold and wild predators of the
                              Italian Alps, the breed's ancestral homeland. Bergamascos are bright, loyal, loving, and
                              trainable' with a dash of mountain-dog independence. They take to watching over loved ones
                              with a serene vigilance. Wary of strangers until properly introduced, Bergamascos are
                              aggressive only as a last resort.

                              The Berger Picard is a lanky herding dog of strong bone and sturdy build. Picards spent
                              centuries as take-charge independent problem-solvers, so early socialization and positive
                              training are necessary to cope with their stubborn streak. You can spot a Berger Picard a
                              mile away thanks to his erect ears standing 4 to 5 inches high, a wavy fawn or brindle
                              coat, and a strong tail that tapers to a distinctive J-hook. Males stand as high as 26
                              inches, and females as low as 21 inches. The eyes are dark and glistening, and the
                              rectangular head is furnished with shaggy eyebrows, beard, and mustache'¬ø the very image
                              of a sagacious and worldly Frenchman. The Berger Picard is an ideal companion for athletic
                              owners. Their rugged constitution, agility, and boundless energy make them eager partners
                              in all kinds of sports, games, and outdoor pastimes. Exercise is a must; prolonged
                              idleness and neglect will likely lead these sensitive, super-smart dogs to destructive
                              behavior.

                              Big, powerful, and built for hard work, the Bernese Mountain Dog is also strikingly
                              beautiful and blessed with a sweet, affectionate nature. Berners are generally placid but
                              are always up for a romp with the owner, whom they live to please. The Bernese Mountain
                              Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick,
                              silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The
                              distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the
                              intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Berner's aura of majestic nobility. A hardy
                              dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner's brain and brawn helped him multitask on the
                              farms and pastures of Switzerland. Berners get along with the entire family and are
                              particularly gentle with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky
                              human. Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof dignity with
                              strangers.

                              and black leathers of the nose and lips. Bichons are adaptable companions who get on well

                              they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no
                              strangers, just friends they haven't met yet. Their confidence and size make them ideal
                              city dogs. Bichons train nicely and enjoy performing for their loved ones. Finally,
                              there's the happy-go-lucky Bichon personality that draws smiles and hugs wherever they go.

                              The Biewer Terrier is an elegant, longhaired, tri-colored toy terrier whose only purpose
                              in life is to love and be loved. They maintain a charming, whimsical attitude well into
                              adulthood. Carrying around a toy or two is not surprising.
                              The Biewer Terrier is a very dedicated, loyal family member and friendly with strangers. A
                              large percentage of the Biewer Terriers are happy-go-lucky dogs, smiling when asked if
                              they are happy. In spite of its small stature, the Biewer is a very hearty, athletic dog
                              and an excellent hunter of vermin. They are lighthearted, have a childlike attitude and
                              like to carry toys in their mouths. He is quick to alert you to company, but is not a
                              constant barker. How do you pronounce Biewer Terrier? Beaver, exactly like out little dam
                              building friends.

                              Large, athletic hunters who work nights, Black and Tan Coonhounds are friendly, easygoing
                              hounds who love company. They are snoozy by the fireside but tenacious when on the trail
                              of the wily raccoon. The Black and Tan Coonhound is a real American original.
                              Black and Tans have an amazingly sensitive nose, long, velvety ears, and a sweet
                              disposition. The coal-black coat features rich tan accents, including the distinctive
                              'pumpkin seeds' above keenly expressive eyes. These are big, strong hounds: A good-size
                              male can stand 27 inches at the shoulder and cover ground with effortless, eager strides.
                              Black and Tan Coonhounds are sociable hounds. A lonely Black and Tan Coonhound will
                              serenade the neighborhood with loud, mournful 'music.' Black and Tan Coonhounds can keep
                              pace with the most active family, but they also can hog the sofa for hours on end. Hounds
                              will be hounds: A passing squirrel can arouse Black and Tan Coonhound prey drive in no
                              time flat, so a strong leash and sturdy fence are must-haves. Black and Tan Coonhounds
                              might be too much hound for the lifestyle of every owner.

                              The Black Russian Terrier is a large, immensely powerful worker of heavy bone and coarse
                              all-black coat. BRTs are known for their courage, confidence, and intelligence. Bred to
                              guard and protect, they are naturally aloof with strangers. What's the word we're looking
                              for? Imposing? Massive? Majestic? How about just plain big. This brawny guard dog of the
                              Siberian steppes can tip the scales at 140 pounds and stand as high as 30 inches at the
                              shoulder. They're much taller when the huge, brick-shaped head is considered. The tousled,
                              all-black coat is warm enough to allow BRTs to patrol some of the coldest habitable places
                              on earth. The old expression 'He moves well for a big guy' applies to this nimble-footed
                              giant.

                              The world-famous 'Sleuth Hound' does one thing better than any creature on earth: find
                              people who are lost or hiding. An off-duty Bloodhound is among the canine kingdom's most
                              docile citizens, but he's relentless and stubborn on a scent.
                              Bloodhounds are large, substantial dogs standing 23 to 27 inches at the shoulder and
                              weighing up to 110 pounds. Their most famous features are a long, wrinkled face with loose
                              skin; huge, drooping ears; and warm, deep-set eyes that complete an expression of solemn
                              dignity. Coat colors can be black and tan, liver and tan, or red. Powerful legs allow
                              Bloodhounds to scent over miles of punishing terrain. As pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy
                              company, including other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes
                              lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy
                              sniffing around are recommended. Bloodhounds are droolers, and obedience training these
                              sensitive sleuths can be a challenge.

                              The sleekly beautiful Bluetick Coonhound is a sweet and affectionate charmer who might
                              enjoy snoozing in the shade, but in pursuit of quarry he is relentless, bold, and
                              single-minded. His off-the-charts prey drive must be channeled. Blueticks are speedy and
                              compact nocturnal hunters named for the mottled (or ticked) black-and-blue pattern of the
                              glossy coat. A large male can top out at 27 inches and 80 pounds; females are smaller.
                              Blueticks are well-muscled but sleek and racy, never chunky or clumsy. The baying,
                              bawling, and chopping bark of Blueticks might be cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters
                              it's the music of the night. The droopy-eared charm of Blueticks is irresistible. They
                              crave affection and are deeply devoted to those who provide it. Blueticks have tremendous

                              impulses can develop problem behaviors, like serenading the neighbors with loud, mournful
                              music.

                              Boerboels are intimidating but discerning guardians of home and family who learned their
                              trade while protecting remote South African homesteads from ferocious predators. They are
                              dominant and confident, also bright and eager to learn. There's a no-frills, no-nonsense
                              quality to this sleek-coated avenger, who might stand as high as 27 inches at the shoulder
                              and weigh as much as you do. A broad and blocky head, powerful jaws, and thick muscles
                              from neck to rump mark it as a descendant of the ancient 'molloser'¬ù dog family, the
                              foundation of today's mastiff-type breeds. In motion, the Boerboel just might be the most
                              agile of all mastiff types. The imposing Boerboel is devoted to protecting the people and
                              places he loves. Training and socialization should begin early, before a pup becomes a
                              dominant adult. This is a trainable, versatile breed, eager to spend time with their
                              adored humans. Still, a Boerboel might be way too much dog for the novice owner to handle.

                              The Bohemian Shepherd is an intelligent, lively, quick, athletic breed which
                              enthusiastically welcomes most any activity introduced, making the breed rather versatile.
                              They succeed in many arenas such as agility, dog dancing, schutzhund, search and rescue,
                              nose work, tracking, pastoral work, obedience, therapy dogs, service dogs, and are now
                              breaking into the fields of coursing, dock diving and endurance tests. The Bohemian
                              Shepherd makes an excellent family dog due to its devotion to family members and adoration
                              of children. This is a breed which loves to be with its family and also does well with
                              other non-human members of the family when raised with them.

                              The Bolognese, a member of the Bichon family, is an enchanting small, white companion dog
                              with a compact and sturdy, square body. The Bolognese is a rather serious dog and
                              generally not high energy but is intelligent and witty.
                              A small companion breed originating in Italy, the Bolognese is a calm, faithful dog with a
                              long, fluffy pure-white coat. They are very playful, easy-going and love people. The
                              Bolognese is small, stocky, and squarely built. He is rather serene and inactive, and
                              devoted to his master and his people. They can be shy towards strangers, but warm up
                              quickly if they are properly socialized. Prone to separation anxiety, the Bolognese does
                              not do well alone for long periods of time. They would be ill-suited for people with a 9-5
                              workday.

                              A remarkably bright workaholic, the Border Collie is an amazing dog maybe a bit too
                              amazing for owners without the time, energy, or means to keep it occupied. These energetic
                              dogs will settle down for cuddle time when the workday is done. Borders are athletic,
                              medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of
                              a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth
                              coat come in a variety of colors and patterns. The almond eyes are the focus of an
                              intelligent expression an intense gaze, the Border's famous herding eye, is a breed
                              hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdom's most agile, balanced, and
                              durable citizens. The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a
                              perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, like agility'¬øor herding or
                              obedience work is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved
                              with strangers.

                              Admirers of the upbeat and agile Border Terrier cherish their breed's reputation as a
                              tough, no-frills working terrier. These plucky, happy, and affectionate dogs are popular
                              pets in town and country. The wiry coat is an easy keeper. Border Terriers, standing from
                              11 to 16 inches at the shoulder, are easy to recognize among other small terriers by their
                              unique head shape the breed has an otter head, as fanciers say. Another distinguishing
                              trait is that they are longer in leg than other small terriers. The wire coat can be
                              grizzle and tan, blue and tan, wheaten, or red. Borders are described as hard as nails
                              when working, but at home they're good-tempered, affectionate, and trainable. Borders love
                              exploring outdoors and make fine childhood playmates. Bred to be country dogs, Borders
                              adapt well to city life as long as they get plenty of exercise. Borders tend to get along
                              with other dogs, but their hunting instincts can be aroused when cats or squirrels cross
                              their path.

                              Among the most impressively beautiful of all dogs, the aristocratic Borzoi is cherished
                              for his calm, agreeable temperament. In full stride, he is a princely package of strength,
                              grace, and glamour flying by at 35 to 40 miles per hour. Borzoi are large, elegant
                              sighthounds. A mature male stands at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 105
                              pounds. Females will be smaller. Beneath the luxurious silky coat, Borzoi construction
                              follows the ancient Greyhound template. One known as the Russian Wolfhound, Borzoi were
                              bred to be swift and tough enough to pursue and pin their ferocious lupine quarry. In
                              their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with
                              patience, consistency, and good humor. Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a
                              bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or
                              squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room
                              is a must.

                              The Boston Terrier is a lively little companion recognized by his tight tuxedo jacket,
                              sporty but compact body, and the friendly glow in his big, round eyes. His impeccable
                              manners have earned him the nickname The American Gentleman. Boston Terriers are compact,
                              short-tailed, well-balanced little dogs weighing no more than 25 pounds. The stylish
                              tuxedo coat can be white and either black, brindle, or seal (dark brown). The head is
                              square, the muzzle is short, and the large, round eyes can shine with kindness, curiosity,
                              or mischief. Ever alert to their surroundings, Bostons move with a jaunty, rhythmic step.
                              It's a safe bet that a breed named for a city the Havanese or Brussels Griffon, for
                              instance will make an excellent urban pet. Bostons are no exception: they are sturdy but
                              portable, people-oriented, and always up for a brisk walk to the park or outdoor cafe. A
                              bright dog with a natural gift for comedy, the dapper Bostonian is a steady source of
                              smiles.

                              They don't build 'em like this anymore. Burly and barrel-chested, the tousle-coated dog of
                              Flandres is from a time and place where a dog had to work like '¬¶ well, a dog. These smart
                              and steady all-purpose workers make excellent watchdogs. Standing as high as 27.5 inches,
                              with heavy bone and powerful muscles beneath a weatherproof coat, and an impressive head
                              accented by beard and mustache, Bouviers can do anything that needs doing in a barnyard or
                              pasture except milk the cows. And yet, Bouviers are more than just farm equipment. Their
                              sterling character, huge heart, and keen intelligence endear them to dog lovers the world
                              over. The Bouvier work ethic must be accommodated, and happily the breed's versatility
                              allows them to do myriad tasks. Bouviers are excellent watchdogs and guardians, and eager
                              participants in dog sports, especially herding trials. These strong-willed dogs do best
                              with owners who can devote ample time and space to a top-of-the-line working dog.

                              Loyalty, affection, intelligence, work ethic, and good looks: Boxers are the whole doggy
                              package. Bright and alert, sometimes silly, but always courageous, the Boxer has been
                              among America's most popular dog breeds for a very long time. A well-made Boxer in peak
                              condition is an awesome sight. A male can stand as high as 25 inches at the shoulder;
                              females run smaller. Their muscles ripple beneath a short, tight-fitting coat. The dark
                              brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. The coat can be
                              fawn or brindle, with white markings. Boxers move like the athletes they are named for:
                              smooth and graceful, with a powerful forward thrust. Boxers are upbeat and playful. Their
                              patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children.
                              They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats
                              fearlessly. Boxers do best when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early
                              puppyhood.

                              A medium-sized flushing and retrieving dog known for its rich brown coat, the Boykin
                              Spaniel is avid, eager, merry, and trainable. This mellow housedog and tenacious bird dog
                              was once South Carolina's best-kept secret. Boykins are medium-sized spaniels, larger and
                              rangier than Cockers but more compact than Springers. The breed's hallmark is a beautiful
                              solid-brown coat. Colors range from a rich liver to a luscious chocolate. The large,
                              feathery ears hang close to the cheeks, setting off an expression of soulful intelligence.
                              Bred to work in the lakes and swamps of their native South Carolina, web-toed Boykins can
                              swim like seals. For years, Boykins were known only to hunters of Carolina waterfowl and
                              wild turkey. But lately, the wider world has discovered that the Boykin is as delightful
                              at home as he is eager at the lake. They are very, very sweet dogs to have around the
                              family, a longtime owner says, but an absolute tiger in the field.

                              The Bracco Italiano is one of the oldest of the pointing breeds. It was introduced into
                              the United States in the 1990s and has remained true to its heritage as a versatile gun
                              dog. It is gentle in the home and tireless in the field.
                              Tough and adapted to all types of hunting, the Bracco Italiano is reliable, intelligent,
                              docile and easy to train. He has a powerful appearance, with lean limbs, well-developed
                              muscles and a sculpted head. In English, he is the Italian Pointing Dog.

                              Pronounced brock-do-bor-bon-NAY, this pointer has a calm, gentle demeanor that is ideally
                              suited for the foot hunter. The breed's relatively small size and short coat well suits
                              them as an ideal home companion for the family that hunts. The Bourbonnais is an ancient
                              breed that evolved in France during the 15th century in the historic province of
                              Bourbonnais. By the 1800s, the breed was known amongst French hunters as a tailless
                              pointer with distinctive fawn and liver ticking. The Braque du Bourbonnais has now gained
                              a strong foothold in North America; some years there are more pups registered in the
                              United States than its homeland of France. In English, he is the Bourbonnais Pointing Dog.
                              He is kind and affectionate in the home and a serious, adaptable, intelligent hunter in
                              the field.

                              The Braque Francais Pyrenean is a rustic breed and hails from France. In English, he is
                              the French Pointing Dog Pyrenean Type.
                              The Braque Francais Pyrenean is a well-proportioned, medium-sized dog with a soft,
                              shorthaired coat. He was bred to hunt the very rugged and arid Pyrenees Mountain range on
                              the border of France and Spain. The breed dates back hundreds of years and is considered
                              the common ancestor to all of today's shorthaired pointing breeds. There are actually two
                              types of Braque Francais: the Gascony Type and the Pyrenean type. The Braque Francais
                              Pyrenean is the smaller and more popular of the two. He has a natural retrieve instinct
                              and loves water. He is gentle, friendly sociable, and submissive.

                              The Briard packs so much loyalty, love, and spirit into its ample frame that it's often described as a "heart wrapped in fur." The dashing good looks of these muscular Frenchmen radiate a distinct aura of Gallic romance and elegance. Briards are herders known for a wavy coat of either gray, tawny, or black, and an impressive head topped by a peek-a-boo hairdo parted naturally in the middle. A luxurious beard and eyebrows accentuate an expression described as frank and questioning. Standing between 22 and 27 inches at the shoulder, Briards are burly and rugged but move with a nimble-footed gait. They possess traits common to many other herders: trainability, brains, a protective eye toward family (especially kids, whom they regard as their flock), and wariness with outsiders. These are large, tireless dogs'¬øit is said that just two or three Briards can handle 700 head of sheep and novice owners might be overwhelmed by their work drive and zest for life.

                              Sportsmen on both sides of the Atlantic cherish the agile, energetic Brittany as a stylish and versatile gundog. Bright and eager at home, and tireless afield, Brittanys require a lot of exercises, preferably with their favorite humans. Brittanys are smaller than setters but leggier than spaniels, standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. Their beautiful, boldly patterned coat comes in combinations of white and vivid orange and liver (reddish-brown). They are rugged and strong but smooth, clean, and quick afoot. The face has the softness prized by bird-dog lovers; high-set ears convey the breed's essential eagerness. The zeal and versatility that make Brittanys peerless hunters can be channeled into dog sports. Obedience, agility, flyball, dock diving you name it, this trainable breed is up for it. The Brittany is a nice fit for those seeking an all-purpose hunting partner, a dog-sport teammate, or a companion in sync with an upbeat, outdoorsy family life.
