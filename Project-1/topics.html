              Great Dane

            <p class="topics-desc">
              Great Danes are enormous, gentle dogs that love spending time with their family, whether on walks or
              lazing at their elbows. Is this gentle gargantuan dog breed right for you?
            </p>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              A Great Dane can grow to be the size of a small horse, but don't let his large, rectangular head and lean
              muscles intimidate you. He's a gentle giant—a loving, loyal, and wonderful addition to any family. He
              cohabitates well with children and smaller animals, with proper supervision: Because he's so gangly, he
              might accidentally step on those shorter than him (and feel really bad about it!).

              Border Collie
            </h1>
            <p class="topics-desc">
              Border collies are intelligent dogs full of energy with a strong desire to herd anything—and
              everything—around them. Learn more about living with border collies.
            </p>
            <p class="topics-desc">
              Border collies are smart dogs with tons of energy and a lust for hard work. This working breed packs a
              powerful punch in a compact body (most only reach 45 pounds max), but, manageable as their size might be,
              that doesn't necessarily make them a good fit for city life.
              Because of their intelligence and extreme energy, border collies will be happiest living with a highly
              active owner (possibly one looking for a new daily running buddy), living on a farm or ranch, or competing
              on the agility course. If you're looking for a playful, well-mannered, nonstop working dog, the border
              collie may be right for you.

              Briard
            </h1>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              Briards are active dogs that will win your affection with their work ethic and rugged good looks. These
              large, long-haired dogs are loyal, affectionate, and confident.
            </p>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              Dating all the way back to the eighth century, briards were the courageous, agile, intelligent flock
              guardians French farmers prized. They won over their humans with their boundless energy and strong work
              ethic, but it didn't take long for their rugged good looks, unwavering loyalty, and affectionate natures
              to make them popular companions today.
              Briards are large dogs that reach up to 27 inches tall and weigh between 55 to 100 pounds. Their coats are
              their most distinctive features. The briard has a fine undercoat and coarse, hard outercoat that lies flat
              in three colors: black, tawny, or black and grey. Their hair is longer on their heads, forming a natural
              (and trendy) center part that frames their dark eyes. On their other end is a well-feathered tail that's
              ready to wag at the first mention of walkies.

              Treeing Walker Coonhound
            </h1>
            <p class="topics-desc">
              Treeing Walker coonhounds are known for helping hunters put food on the table and winning hunting
              competitions, but these hound dogs can serve as excellent, active companions for you and your family—no
              matter where you live.
            </p>
            <p class="topics-desc">
              Nobody wants a dog known for barking up the wrong tree, so maybe you should adopt one whose breed is best
              known for barking up the right tree: The Treeing Walker coonhound.
              Beloved by hunters, Treeing Walkers—who "tree" their prey (usually raccoons and other smaller mammals) by
              chasing them up a tree and then barking to let the hunter know where the animal is—can also make loyal
              family pets.
              But Treeing Walkers are so versatile that you don't even need to live next to a woodsy acreage (though
              your pup certainly wouldn't hate that). The medium-sized hounds will be plenty happy simply spending time
              with you and your family.

              Peekapoo
            </h1>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              The Peekapoo, a cross between a miniature or toy poodle and a Pekingese, is an adorable, affectionate
              lapdog. Although the “designer” dogs are small in size, the breed is known for his big bark.
            </p>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              The Peekapoo is considered one of the original "designer" or hybrid dog breeds. The first Pekingese-poodle
              mixes were bred in the 1950s to meet the demand for small dogs with low-shedding, "hypoallergenic" coats,
              and the breed remains popular today.
              Similar to their parent breeds, adult Peekapoos are small in stature, standing less than 11 inches tall
              and weighing between 4 to 20 pounds. A Pekingese crossed with a toy poodle is smallest and called a teacup
              Peekapoo. But what these dogs lack in size, they make up for in personality.
