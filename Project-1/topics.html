              Dogs could differentiate breath and sweat samples from people before and after a stress-inducing task
            </p>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              The physiological processes associated with an acute psychological stress response produce changes in
              human breath and sweat that dogs can detect with an accuracy of 93.75%, according to a new study published
              this week in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Clara Wilson of Queen's University Belfast, UK, and
              colleagues.
              In the new study, the researchers collected samples of breath and sweat from non-smokers who had not
              recently eaten or drank. Samples were collected both before and after a fast-paced arithmetic task, along
              with self-reported stress levels and objective physiological measures: heart rate (HR) and blood pressure
              (BP). Samples from 36 participants who reported an increase in stress because of the task, and experienced
              an increase in HR and BP during the task, were shown to trained dogs within three hours of being
              collected. Four dogs of different breeds and breed-mixes had been trained, using a clicker as well as
              kibble, to match odors in a discrimination task. At testing, dogs were asked to find the participant's
              stress sample (taken at the end of the task) while the same person's relaxed sample (taken only minutes
              before, prior to the task starting) was also in the sample line-up.
              Overall, dogs could detect and perform their alert behavior on the sample taken during stress in 675 out
              of 720 trials, or 93.75% of the time, much greater than expected by chance (p0.001) The first time they
              were exposed to a participant's stressed and relaxed samples, the dogs correctly alerted to the stress
              sample 94.44% of the time. Individual dogs ranged in performance from 90% to 96.88% accuracy.

              Boisterous puppy finds calling as fire search dog
            </h1>
            <p class="topics-desc">
              Merlin was given to Northumbria Police as his owners found him too energetic, and the force passed him on
              to Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service.
              The Dutch herder Labrador cross has been trained to reach casualties in hard-to-reach locations.
              Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Kim McGuinness said he was "destined to be a hero".
            </p>
            <p class="topics-desc">
              Merlin was taken in by watch manager Steve Carr and has been trained alongside police dogs.
              He has now been certified as a specialist search dog who could be used to find someone lost in woods or
              people trapped in a collapsed building, barking when he has located a casualty.
              Chief Fire Officer Chris Lowther said: "Merlin will be able to reach places our firefighters simply can't
              reach, so that he can identify the location of any casualties during an emergency response."
              Ms McGuinness said: "With his energy and character, Merlin is destined to be a hero, and we're all so
              happy he's found his calling in life."

              "I regret my dog's name - it's far too common and doesn't suit him"
            </h1>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              Choosing a puppy's name is a big decision and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. It needs to reflect
              their personality and character, it has to be quick and easy to pronounce, and you need to love it enough
              to say it every single day. If it's too complicated, they might not respond - but if it's too popular, you
              may find other dogs come running in the park.
              One dog owner is regretting their choice of name for their young golden retriever and is considering
              changing it to something less common. Taking to Reddit, the pet parent asked fellow dog lovers: "Is it
              wrong to change his name at five-months-old? Named him Ollie and it's not fitting. It's also a super
              common dog name around here."
            </p>

            <p class="topics-desc">
              The puppy owner asked Redditors to suggest different names for the young golden retriever.
              One person suggested Ozzy while another said Dexter and a third proposed Benny.
              Bob, Toby and Peanut were also among the comments, as well as Dudley, Rusty and Elvis.
              Some people recommended finding a nickname instead of changing his name entirely.
              "We have so many nicknames for ours that she responds to all of them, Maggie, Maggie Moo, Moo Moo,
              Mahmooski. I think it's more about the inflection than the name itself," someone said.
              "We call ours so many nicknames he probably doesn't even know what his name is and he's five months too,"
              another agreed.
